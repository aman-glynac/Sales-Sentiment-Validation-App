The proposal submitted was based off of focusing on maximizing deliverables (we discounted and comped consulting hours and multiple facilitators) vs price. It sounds like price is the issue here, so I am comfortable with us discounting this further, we are invested in this partnership.\r\n\r\n\r\n  1.  I am happy to schedule a call to support you and our partnership with your CEO. We have found that discussing the strategic initiatives we are choosing to work on together with the C-suite, and supporting the relevant data points that will follow goes a long way. We are ecstatic for the impact we can drive together that is beyond both of our <LOCATION> based businesses.\r\n  2.  I approve discounting this project further by another 20%. This would lower the cost to $7,200 and maintain the consulting hours (comped).\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease let me know if that will address the concerns. Happy to schedule a quick call to best understand what can support this initiative moving forward.",

Here are a few that come to mind, and we'd love to hop on a call to discuss your responses and other questions to help you get started.\r\n\r\n  *   What are two top priorities for HawkSEM in 2023? (Does not have to be DEI specific)\r\n  *   What aspect of your DEI-centric work has been positively received? Why?\r\n  *   Describe an unmet need or area of expertise that would benefit the talent recruitment and retention process.\r\n  *   What does successful DEI strategy look like to you?\r\nIf you can't attend today, let us know.

I also know you were looking at putting some structure around your recruiting and hiring process, you were prioritizing building and maintaining a psychologically safe culture and wanted to focus on retention as well, and you were also planning how to upskill managers around inclusive leadership behaviors including giving feedback inclusively.\r\n\r\nI know <PERSON> sent you a pdf with a sampling of our solutions, but I wonder if you and I could meet to start from scratch, if you're still looking for support around DEI?\r\n\r\nThis is my bio -->",

I recognize that you are in a unique organization with nuanced challenges in scaling training. Our team is adept at curating programming that meets people where they are in their understanding of DEI and also at utilizing learning modalities that make these important pieces of training accessible to all constituents.\n\nI'm attaching an overview of our firm and some of the programs that come to mind as possible solutions. Because our eLearning is a subscription model, we can easily build out a subscription for you that includes multiple programs and distinct learning paths. I include a few samples of those for you on the attached.\n\nAdditionally, I remember you stressing a need to curate experiential learning opportunities where leaders engage and practice the act of inclusion, while also action planning. Our program, Leading with Conscious Inclusion, is designed specifically for this type of learning experience and so I've included information on that program as well. The program can be facilitated as a stand alone program; however, if the participants are new to inclusive leadership or to exploring their roles in creating a sustainable culture of inclusion, we do recommend that they begin with the Building a Culture of Inclusion program. \n\nTo best support you, I'd love to get time on your calendar and include one of our principal consultants. By including them, we can really hone in on the best recommendations for you and you'll have the opportunity to ideate with our thought leaders. \n\nDo you have some time this week to connect?

However, recently, we're hearing that many of these DEI initiatives are stalling. If this is happening in your workplace, I want to share a few resources with you.\n\nOn Tuesday, May 30 at 12pm: <URL> we are going to be hosting a webinar called \u201cAsk an Expert Anything: Responding to Resistance to DEI,\u201d facilitated by Executive Coach and Master Facilitator <PERSON>, <PERSON>, SPHR. This forum will be safe space to explore ways to overcome resistance in the workplace and will help you to identity specific language to use and avoid when resistance surfaces.\n\nIn addition, we know that 2023 is halfway over, but there is still time to make impact. Right now, XYZ is offering a 30% discount on any new statement of work signed by June 30, 2023. If there is anything that you need or any program that you're curious about, let me know.

        "body": "Dear Kimberly,\n\nHave you ever wondered why AAPI Heritage Month is celebrated in May? \nIn 1978, US Congress created an observation week to commemorate the first <NRP> immigrants arriving in the <LOCATION> in May of 1843 as well as the completion of the transcontinental railroad on May 10, 1869. In 1992, the observance was expanded to a month, and the census distinguished <NRP> and <NRP> for the first time. We celebrate this month to acknowledge the history and accomplishments of the AAPI community and stand against the upsurge in coronavirus-related xenophobia seen heavily in the past 3 years. As an educational resource in your authentic allyship, we would like to share a link to last year\u2019s podcast on Supporting Colleagues of Asian & Pacific Islander Descent:",

We talked briefly about how traveling internationally can aid in connecting across differences. A conference session I attended this year was called \u201cMultiple Pathways to Intercultural Competence in the COVID-era\u201d by Dr. <PERSON> who discussed how you can connect across differences without international experiences. She mentioned that four key elements to support social diversity and relationships were:\r\n\r\n\r\n  *   Equal Status\r\n  *   Meaningful goals\r\n  *   Support from authority\r\n  *   The opportunity for cooperation\r\n\r\nI loved Dr. Peifer\u2019s<<URL>> talk and thought you would too given our discussion on the intersections of interculturalism and DEI!\r\n\r\nI\u2019ve attached XYZ\u2019s proposal for e-learning, micro-learning, and IDI assessment options. Could we set up some time next week to see if you have any questions about the programs? Here\u2019s a few times that we are available:\r\n\r\n\r\n  *   Tuesday, May 16th at 2pm EST\r\n  *   Wednesday, May 17th at 1pm EST\r\n  *   Thursday, May 18th at 11am EST\r\n\r\nLet me know if any of those times work for you and we look forward to touching base soon!",

Introducing myself (XYZ/DEI solutions)Hi <PERSON> a longtime XYZ consultant, facilitator, IDI\u00ae coach, and content developer. Here is my short bio. <PERSON> is on my team. First, y\u2019all have a stunning website! Wow. But of course you do, given what business you\u2019re in. Second, I wanted to reach out to see if scheduling a meeting would be a good idea so we can get moving on your needs at the speed you need. I\u2019ve carefully reviewed notes about our discussions with The Imagine Group so far, and would love to answer any questions and respond to you as soon as possible. I know that y\u2019all \u00a0received a grant by the Minnesota Department of Employment and Economic Development (congratulations!) and I know that you and <PERSON> are committed to DE&I \u2013 and your goal is to make your workplace equitable and inclusive from a systemic and mindset standpoint. Fantastic! I also know from last time we talked that you wanted to target your leaders across Twin Cities HQ and corporate field support roles (~70-105 people) first, and leaders in <LOCATION> (36), <LOCATION> (28) and <LOCATION> (24) in subsequent waves. \u00a0 I\u2019ve also reviewed the below outline that you sent us earlier this year (super helpful, thank you!): OutcomesPeople understand and appreciate what DEI is and why it is a business focus.Learners understand the concept of implicit bias, how it\u2019s measures and the harm it <URL><PERSON> about themselves and where they can take steps to <URL><PERSON> new strategies to improve and commit to 1-2 actions/strategies they will begin to employ to improve their own efforts to understand and include in the workplace and life.Timing Wave 1: \u00a0June \u2013 <PERSON>: TC People Leaders, FST\u201cUnconscious <PERSON> and Prejudice Habit-Breaking\u201d \u00a0OutlineTeach what DEI is and why Imagine is focused on this within our culture and for our business.Teach what implicit bias is, how it\u2019s measured, and how it harms women and people of color.Take the Implicit Association Test, which demonstrates that we all fall prey to unconscious bias to a degree and provide feedback on their personal level of bias.Teach how to overcome bias through a combination of strategies, including calling out stereotyped views, gathering more individualized information about people, reflecting on counterstereotypical examples, adopting the perspectives of others, and increasing interactions with different kinds of <URL>k participants to come up with examples of how they could use above strategies in their own lives. Reinforce that strategies support one another and that the more they\u2019re practiced, the more effective they will be. \u00a0Please let us know if you\u2019d still like to chat, we\u2019d love to help you in any capacity we can.

We have instructional design expertise on these topics. What are the topics and current content of the coaching experience? Is it how to succeed in a <LOCATION> audience and interviews with <NRP>? Is it technical role substance? Something else?Lorenzo: No need to dive deeper, the coaching is around general approaches to job search in <LOCATION>, no industry specific technical <URL>mmary of what UG needs:<PERSON> (which just means pedagogy, but for Adults!) Framework:Deliverable: Short, concise document that briefly outlines main adult-learning practices and frameworks and how UpGlo can use them. Document skills and learning objectives that define each step of the jobseeking coaching journey, and what coaches need to enable their work. UpGlo has examples tied to the way they\u2019re already doing it, they already have some ideas, which they will share with <URL>tting up an Instructional Resources Process:Deliverable: Similar to the above, show them options for designing the coaching training manual (for example, <PERSON> vs. <PERSON>) and in practice what would it look like within the constraints of their resources and time. Also, what does the versioning cycle look like, what\u2019s the ideal vs. the in-practice realistic version. A short practice-oriented document. Sounded like, what is our recommendations for what the process should be for them to design the coaching training/<URL>asurement & Evaluation \u2013Deliverable: Recommendations for how to monitor effectiveness of, and evaluate the coaching program. UpGlow said that they have some tools to collate KPI\u2019s but they want to strengthen them. What questions are we asking and how are we using the results? Really doing sth with the insights/information so they don\u2019t just sit <URL>elopment of Instructional Resources: (this sounds like the biggest piece)Deliverable: Collaborate with UpGlo to <NRP> and improve the materials they have. If we see big gaps, this could involve collaborating on building some new content, but it wouldn\u2019t be anything big due to time constraints (e.g., we\u2019re not building Articulate Rise in 3 months for example). They already have cultural competent resources, we\u2019d examine them. We want to continually improve. If we see large gaps that would be a longer term project. \u00a0We\u2019re about to hire a instructional designer who will work with XYZ in our small project team. Examples of instructional resources: decks, pdfs, email templates, 1on1 or group session agendas, online micro courses developed in Articulate Rise 360 (primarily text and visual based, no videos or voiceover), assessment materials.Certification Evaluation:Deliverable: a document that shows our recommendations for how to create a certification program of their coaching program (so they can certify people in other organizations on it). They\u2019re starting with \u2018no knowing how this work\u2019 and want to know what are the options, how they should it up. What are the options and what are the pros and cons of each <URL><PERSON> asked: are you more focused on cultural competence or instructional design? Instructional design, with some CC.Lorenzo:We understand that it\u2019s possible that there isn\u2019t one vendor that might have subject matter expertise on everything in this RFP. It could be that we have different vendors for each section. Depending on the strengths of each vendor.Would like to do this by the end of April, could be 3-4 months after that.2 tiers: Budget depends on level of detail\u00b7 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 $200k\u00b7 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 $350k (longer term)Can we see what the coaching content / training manual looks like?10:01am: RP had to go to another client call and missed the last part of the meeting\u2026",

We are a 23 year-old culture focused, trainings e-learnings can be delivered in any language. CH: I\u2019m on the fundraising team. I\u2019m on this call because I\u2019m a part of our staff retreat planning group. We are late to the game for getting this retreat planned, I\u2019m late to making it happen and seeing if this is a good fit. \u00a0Can I give you some background? AK: Of course! CH: Founded in 2021, we are a start-up with 22 people. Grown significantly. Organizational partners, grown quickly. Small team with a lot of movement from the start. We work primarily with black and latino families and kids. Everyone here is mission-focued. We did one staff retreat last year, we\u2019re building another one last year. Our team is pretty diverse, represents the population we work with. The black and latino communities are very different, especially when it comes to family relations, lots of latino parents are undocumented. Vision is we don\u2019t want to rely on our staff members. Ideally, some sort of training that focuses on both communities. \u201cWhat language are we using to describe in both communities\u201d. Does that resonate with you and something you know how to do? AK: What I\u2019d like to do to give a roadmap. First question: last minute, can it be supported? Yes. Facilitator <PERSON> is in <LOCATION>. We can support that close to the date. What we focus in on is focus. How large is your executive team? CH: 5-6 AK: Where we know where to start with folks. We meet people where we start \u2013 prior to the retreat, facilitate an assessment, debrief, going into retreat. What I need to be aware of myself. Systems and pieces in place. Then, during the retreat, <PERSON> will lead a spotlight. Culture native and cultural ally. Why we change behaviors is because CH: Haven\u2019t done this training before. Does <PERSON> work for both culture natives? AK: No, but we would work with you to find the right people. CH: We could bring in each person separately. AK: Each come in different packages \u2013 4 hours, 2 hours. \u201cwhite glove\u201d CH: Budget \u2013 we don\u2019t have a set budget, only because we\u2019ve done one staff retreat before. Do you have a price range for a half day of training. AK: Are you looking for us to do a multi-staff training? Or is it only for executives. What are the expectations on how you\u2019d like us to work with you. CH: The idea of starting at square 1, how does the IDI executive part work. Online? [Importance of IDI] AK: Assessment they do on their own time, the debriefs need folks there. CH: As a next step, would someone schedule a meeting with our retreat planning team? AK: Absolutely.

Understand how many organizations have historically exploited the holiday. Explore ways in which individuals and organizations can commit to supporting and advocating for <NRP> communities beyond designated months or holidays.

        "body": "Dear Janet,\u200b\n\nI hope this message finds you well. At XYZ, we are always striving to innovate and provide the most impactful solutions for fostering Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion within organizations. With that commitment in mind, we are excited to introduce our updated and elevated training program: The Cross Cultural Learning Partner (CCLP).\n\nWhat makes our CCLP program stand out from traditional DEI training programs? It\u2019s designed to offer a more personalized, in-depth, and continuous learning experience. Here\u2019s how:\nCollaborative Learning: Unlike typical trainings where participants learn individually, CCLP pairs each participant with a learning partner that is culturally different in a significant way. This partnership encourages mutual support and shared growth, making the learning process richer and more effective. The cultural differences between partners offer real, lived scenarios that can be explored through open communication. Extended Engagement: While most DEI sessions are limited to just a few hours, our CCLP program spans 6 to 12 months. This extended timeframe allows for a deeper exploration of cultural competencies, continuous learning, and the opportunity to apply and reflect on insights over time. Real-World Scenarios: CCLP moves beyond hypothetical situations by integrating your unique experiences into the training. This makes the learning more relevant and directly applicable to the challenges and opportunities within your organization. Measurable Growth: Understanding your progress is key to effective learning. CCLP includes pre- and post-assessments, enabling participants to track their development and gain clear insights into how much they\u2019ve grown after the program. We believe that our CCLP program offers a transformative approach to DEI training, and we would love to explore how it can benefit your team or organization. If you\u2019re interested in learning more or setting up a time to discuss further, please don\u2019t hesitate to reach out.",

        "body": "Hello Janet,\u200b \n\nI hope you're doing well. I wanted to follow up on my previous email regarding our Cross Cultural Learning Partner (CCLP) program, as I understand things can get busy. \n\nTo quickly recap, the CCLP program is an innovative and personalized DEI training designed to foster deeper cultural understanding and sustained growth. The Intercultural Development Inventory (IDI) Assessment is a crucial tool within the CCLP program, helping participants not only identify where they are in terms of intercultural competence but also guiding them through the phases of development. Here's how it elevates the training experience: \nUnderstanding Key Developmental Phases: Throughout the program, participants will navigate various phases of intercultural development, progressing from a primarily monocultural perspective to a more inclusive intercultural viewpoint. This understanding is essential for fostering inclusive environments and navigating cultural differences effectively. Targeted Growth: By taking the IDI assessment at the beginning of the program, participants establish a clear baseline of where they currently stand in their intercultural development journey. We follow up with post IDI assessments as well conducted at the end of the program. This allows us to clearly measure the progress they've made, highlighting the growth in their ability to navigate and understand cultural differences more effectively over the 6-12 month program. We\u2019d love to set up a time to discuss how the IDI assessment and the CCLP program can be implemented to meet your team\u2019s needs. Please let me know what week works best, and I can send over some times to connect. \n\nLooking forward to your response.",

What\u2019s driving it from a gender perspective? In some cases there\u2019s a wide gap.What actions can we take from there?I\u2019ve pulled out over 200k comments, the data we already have.We have done focus groups in the past (as a result of 2021 survey results) but won\u2019t be doing any more. We won\u2019t be sharing any focus group data with XYZ, only the survey comments.We found that there were different expectations pre and post pandemic - before great resignation and after.<PERSON> studied the quantitative answers to questions (Likert scale scores), but we haven\u2019t done as good a job with the sentiment analysis\u2026 we haven\u2019t looked at the actual comments.We want you to look at all the comments since 2019. There are 70 questions in the global survey. Every month there\u2019s an algorithm in our platform (Workday Peakon Employee Voice Pulse Survey) that sorts 5-7 questions people receive out of that pool of 70 <URL>e 200k comments is for <LOCATION> (<LOCATION>, <LOCATION>, and <LOCATION>) but we can focus on <LOCATION> only. \u00a0<PERSON>: We don\u2019t want you to only look at comments that pertain to specific gender gaps that we found, we want you to look at all the data. What we want are general themes and trends and challenges, this is priority #1 (not necessarily just the ones where gender differences are pronounced).The data we\u2019d send XYZ is organized in spreadsheets (70 of them) with columns by date, business unit, other criteria. There\u2019s no gender column but some of the spreadsheets represent women and men. They don\u2019t have a single cumulative report of all 200k comments. They will send us a sample spreadsheet, with maybe ten rows of info, so we can get a taste. \u00a0They\u2019ve used \u201cPower BI\u201d (a platform that helps users analyze, visualize, and share data to make informed decisions, from Microsoft) to try to analyze the comments and have created some initiatives based on that, but it\u2019s too high <URL>e Workday survey has 21 drivers (autonomy, engagement, environment, etc.):Each driver has sub-drivers, and each sub-driver has 1 or more survey questions associated with it. \u00a0For example, the environment driver has 3 sub drivers (Equipment with two survey questions, Collab Space with 1 question, and <LOCATION> with 1 question).

        "body": "[cid:<URL>g@01D9CED4.2E0CF510]\r\n<PERSON>,\r\n\r\nIt was such a pleasure meeting with you on 1 August. We appreciate your taking the time to give us an overview of your current DEI needs.\r\nOur understanding of your need:\r\nSouthlake Regional Health Centre is seeking a partner to help drive DEI mindsets and behavior within its hospital staff, both clinical and administrative. In particular, there is a need to provide learning interventions to front-line staff, professionals and employees who work directly with patients and the public and who do not necessarily have the time to sit through a workshop, including nurses and PSWs.\r\n\r\n\r\n  *   In the proposal we include the \"Identifying Unconscious Bias\" <PERSON>, a short (15-20 min) internally-led lesson and conversation around a particular topic for constituents such as these. The deliverable includes a pdf with Facilitator Guide and <PERSON>, plus a meeting to walk you through the content. I want to send you a sample of this microlesson, but I'd like to tailor it to the health care industry, so I'll send it to you by this Wednesday.\r\n\r\nWe also talked about embedding inclusion and antibias education within your onboarding Core Curriculum.\r\n\r\n\r\n  *   In the proposal we've included access to our eLearnings, \"Introduction to Managing Unconscious Bias\" and \"Culture & Identity\", both of which you've had the chance to review.\r\n     *   These would sit in your LMS.\r\n     *   Our eLearning pricing is on subscription and it's on tiers of 'seats'. Each seat is  a unique user, in other words a unique email address. So if you went into the system using your email address, you can go in as many times as you wanted during the year. I selected the 1,501-3000 seats tier for <LOCATION>. The next tier is 3,001-6,000 but I'm guessing you may not have that many users in a year?\r\n     *   There is also an option to purchase an enterprise-wide site license, where you could keep one or both eLearnings forever. That would of course entail a significantly larger up front cost. Please let me know if that interests you!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  *   In the proposal we've also included our 2-hour online facilitated course, \"Managing Unconscious Bias in the Workplace\".\r\n     *   This course explores how unconscious biases influence how we perceive, treat, and evaluate people - and how they prevent us from activating the full potential of our teams. Using relevant, real examples and working through various activities that relate to the real-world workplace, participants learn strategies to recognize, limit, and mitigate biases in making assessments and judgments in our everyday work and relationships.\r\n     *   This course also covers specific cognitive unconscious biases that affect workplace decisions, microinequities and how we can counter them, the impact of coded language, and the importance of not staying silent in creating a culture of conscious inclusion. Participants walk away with ideas, tips, and strategies for addressing bias respectfully and confidently.\r\n     *   Introduction to Managing Unconscious Bias eLearning is recommended as pre-work for this session.\r\n\r\nFinally, we talked about possibly presenting the \"Spotlight in Indigenous Peoples of North America\" in September, in advance of National Day for Truth and Reconciliation. We've also included this 1-hr session in our proposal.\r\n\r\n\r\n  *   Indigenous societies have flourished for thousands of years in the <LOCATION>, and their cultural contributions continue to impact modern life across <LOCATION>. Today, there are more than 630 First Nation communities in <LOCATION> and over 560 federally recognized <NRP> tribes in the <LOCATION>\r\n  *   This session investigates the complicated relationship between Indigenous communities and the government, explores the rich traditions of Indigenous peoples in <LOCATION> (including <LOCATION> and the <LOCATION>), and shares insight on some of the social issues Indigenous communities face today, so you can begin to understand the experience of your Indigenous talent, clients, and market. This session is co-facilitated by an Indigenous culture-insider and a non-Indigenous culture-ally.\r\n\r\nWe also very much understand and appreciate that the DEI experience in <LOCATION> is different than in the <LOCATION>, from history to terminology, to immigrant populations, linguistic diversity, and legislation. We would facilitate these sessions through this lens.\r\n\r\n\r\nHere<<URL>> is a link to our proposal for your review. The amounts are in <LOCATION>. I confirmed with our finance leader that we're able to lock in today's exchange rate at USD$1 = <NRP>.\r\n\r\n\r\nChantelle, if our response is only almost right for your needs, then we look forward to hearing from you so that we can respond swiftly, make adjustments, and get you what you need to ensure alignment!\r\n\r\nWe would proud to have you as a client, given the important work <PERSON> does! I'll send you the microlesson example on Wednesday, then we can check back with you next week if that's okay. Otherwise, please let me know what next steps should be.",

        "body": "[cid:<URL>g@01D9D5B0.61C45F00]\r\n<PERSON>,\r\n\r\nIt was such a pleasure meeting with you on 1 August. We appreciate your taking the time to give us an overview of your current DEI needs.\r\nOur understanding of your need:\r\nSouthlake Regional Health Centre is seeking a partner to help drive DEI mindsets and behavior within its hospital staff, both clinical and administrative. In particular, there is a need to provide learning interventions to front-line staff, professionals and employees who work directly with patients and the public and who do not necessarily have the time to sit through a workshop, including nurses and PSWs.\r\n\r\n\r\n  *   In the proposal we include the \"Identifying Unconscious Bias\" <PERSON>, a short (15-20 min) internally-led lesson and conversation around a particular topic for constituents such as these. The deliverable includes a pdf with Facilitator Guide and <PERSON>, plus a meeting to walk you through the content. I want to send you a sample of this microlesson, but I'd like to tailor it to the health care industry, so I'll send it to you by this Wednesday.\r\n\r\nWe also talked about embedding inclusion and antibias education within your onboarding Core Curriculum.\r\n\r\n\r\n  *   In the proposal we've included access to our eLearnings, \"Introduction to Managing Unconscious Bias\" and \"Culture & Identity\", both of which you've had the chance to review.\r\n     *   These would sit in your LMS.\r\n     *   Our eLearning pricing is on subscription and it's on tiers of 'seats'. Each seat is  a unique user, in other words a unique email address. So if you went into the system using your email address, you can go in as many times as you wanted during the year. I selected the 1,501-3000 seats tier for <LOCATION>. The next tier is 3,001-6,000 but I'm guessing you may not have that many users in a year?\r\n     *   There is also an option to purchase an enterprise-wide site license, where you could keep one or both eLearnings forever. That would of course entail a significantly larger up front cost. Please let me know if that interests you!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  *   In the proposal we've also included our 2-hour online facilitated course, \"Managing Unconscious Bias in the Workplace\".\r\n     *   This course explores how unconscious biases influence how we perceive, treat, and evaluate people - and how they prevent us from activating the full potential of our teams. Using relevant, real examples and working through various activities that relate to the real-world workplace, participants learn strategies to recognize, limit, and mitigate biases in making assessments and judgments in our everyday work and relationships.\r\n     *   This course also covers specific cognitive unconscious biases that affect workplace decisions, microinequities and how we can counter them, the impact of coded language, and the importance of not staying silent in creating a culture of conscious inclusion. Participants walk away with ideas, tips, and strategies for addressing bias respectfully and confidently.\r\n     *   Introduction to Managing Unconscious Bias eLearning is recommended as pre-work for this session.\r\n\r\nFinally, we talked about possibly presenting the \"Spotlight in Indigenous Peoples of North America\" in September, in advance of National Day for Truth and Reconciliation. We've also included this 1-hr session in our proposal.\r\n\r\n\r\n  *   Indigenous societies have flourished for thousands of years in the <LOCATION>, and their cultural contributions continue to impact modern life across <LOCATION>. Today, there are more than 630 First Nation communities in <LOCATION> and over 560 federally recognized <NRP> tribes in the <LOCATION>\r\n  *   This session investigates the complicated relationship between Indigenous communities and the government, explores the rich traditions of Indigenous peoples in <LOCATION> (including <LOCATION> and the <LOCATION>), and shares insight on some of the social issues Indigenous communities face today, so you can begin to understand the experience of your Indigenous talent, clients, and market. This session is co-facilitated by an Indigenous culture-insider and a non-Indigenous culture-ally.\r\n\r\nWe also very much understand and appreciate that the DEI experience in <LOCATION> is different than in the <LOCATION>, from history to terminology, to immigrant populations, linguistic diversity, and legislation. We would facilitate these sessions through this lens.\r\n\r\n\r\nHere<<URL>> is a link to our proposal for your review. The amounts are in <LOCATION>.

        "body": "Hello <PERSON>, <PERSON>, <PERSON>, <PERSON>, and <PERSON> \u2013\r\n\r\nIt was a pleasure meeting with y\u2019all on Monday, we appreciate your taking the time to give us an overview of your translation needs \u2013 which includes DEI assets (education materials, newsletters, ERG related items, etc.), HR communications and documents, internal communications and marketing assets, and the JH website.\r\n\r\nWe\u2019d of course be delighted to be your one stop shop for Jensen Hughes\u2019 translation and localization needs, and believe we\u2019d be a great fit. Our number one priority would be to get to know your needs and preferences thoroughly, and to consistently get it right for you and your employees, clients, vendors and other stakeholders around the world.  We\u2019d also be proud to have you as a client, given the important work you do.\r\n\r\nAttached are:\r\n\r\n\r\n  1.  TRANSLATION RATES & TERMS_2023\r\n\r\nA 4-pager that summarizes our standard translation services, including:\r\n\r\n  *   Rates\r\n  *   Translation memories\r\n  *   Turnaround times\r\n  *   Rush options\r\n  *   eLearning and multimedia\r\n  *   Cultural adaptations\r\n  *   Desktop publishing\r\n  *   Highly specialized translations\r\n  *   JH internal review option\r\n\r\nI underline the word \u2018standard\u2019 above because we can exert some flexibility depending on what the project/s is/are.  Are you able to share your budget or budget range for translation of your website for example?\r\n\r\n\r\n  1.  Two pdf\u2019s: Sample-MgingBiasHiring-ENG and Sample-MgingBiasHiring-CHS: This is a sample of our translated work, a 2-page job aid around managing bias in hiring. We include the source English material and translation into simplified <NRP>.\r\n\r\nAdditional info:\r\n\r\n  *   We routinely translate a wide range of materials/formats: from documents in any Office format, to in InDesign, XML, HTML, eLearnings, videos, other multimedia, etc. And our deliverables are generally in the same as what we received and we include any layout work that may be needed to accomplish that.\r\n  *   We also offer subtitling and voiceover as they are often used for eLearnings.\r\n  *   Usually we\u2019ll give you a cost estimate relatively quickly once you provide us with the source document. When we\u2019re talking about larger projects, like a website, we would I would usually suggest a project call at the start of the project to align on details (volume, deadlines, deliverables in priority order, notes on specialized terminology, etc.).\r\n  *   We\u2019d love to work with you on a relatively small project to start, so you can test us out to see if we\u2019d be a good fit.\r\n\r\nIf the above is only almost right for your needs, then we look forward to hearing any concerns so that we can respond swiftly and get you what you need to ensure alignment!\r\n\r\nAll the best, <PERSON>, <PERSON>, and the XYZ team\r\n\r\n\r\n<PERSON>\r\n(she/her)\r\nHead of Business Development\r\nXYZ\r\n\r\n-----Original Appointment-----",

We are suggesting an assessment which includes an audit of cultural mindset (we will review Entromy Survey results and conduct interviews), accompanied by review of key systems and processes (eg talent mgmt, HRIS) as part of the overall evaluation to determine the best and targeted approach to building your DEI strategy and ensuring the focus of that strategy is on point for maximum impact and change.\u00a0 Many organizations fall into the pitfall of not focusing on the priorities that will help to drive meaningful change and a fuller assessment will help us finetune and target actions that will be more relevant to Orveon.\u00a0 This would not require a survey but we would review your results from <LOCATION>.\u00a0 Did you mean something else by \"survey\"?\n2. We understand your financial pressures and are happy to work with you.\u00a0 We could offer a 15% discount on your discovery and assessment if we started this year. This would be a savings of $4350 and we can work out a timed payment structure to allow you to pay just a portion before year end that could fit your budget. (e.g. a portion of the phase 1 strategy fee). This Assessment phase will not require a heavy lift from the Orveon team.\u00a0 May we set up time to discuss?\nAttached is the new proposal with reworked numbers as well as new discounted offer but I am also offering a quick call as we are open to discussing.\u00a0\nI have availability Monday, Oct 16 after 4pmET or Wednesday,\u00a0Oct 18 prior to 12pm ET.\nHave a great weekend\n\t\nDeb",

As a follow up to our conversation, I am attaching a power point deck that provides some preliminary scoping and recommendations based on our discussion. It includes more details about our approach to collaborating and building a DEI strategy as well as an overview of just some of our content, specifically focused on <PERSON> and Building a Culture of Inclusion. We of course, have many other courses such as navigating across cultures, immersive experiences and targeted bias in talent processes but thought we would start with these. Please note that while we did provide some pricing, we are very open to discussing your budget and adapting a plan that meets those needs. \u00a0Our goal is to partner with you to find the best, cost-effective solutions for Orveon. It would be great to schedule some time with you to go over your thoughts and reactions once you've had a chance to review.Would the first or second week of September work? Warm regards,Deb",

        "body": "Hi <PERSON>,\r\n\r\nHope you\u2019re having a great week! For the proposal for BCI, we agree that based on your given group size, the best option moving forward would be to hold two separate BCI sessions that include IDI Group Debriefs for the JEDI Counsel and the Leadership Team.\r\n\r\nRecommended Option: Two BCI sessions, where two group IDI debriefs are included.\r\n\r\n  *   Timeline, starting with individual IDI assessments & individual coaching.\r\n\r\n     *   Participants should take the assessment and participate in the individual debrief before 9/15, allowing ample time for the consultant to build the group\u2019s aggregate results in the BCI program.\r\n\r\n  *   BCI sessions on October 2nd & 3rd.\r\n\r\nWe recommend doing the individual debriefs before you go into a group setting to receive the aggregate results. Doing the IDI assessment and debriefs first helps individuals since they\u2019ll know where they individually sit on the continuum in advance and can find some solidarity in understanding they are not alone in the process. Participants also have a better understanding of what the group dynamic could represent because of the insights from the IDI debrief and their contributions to that group.\r\n\r\nAs for your question regarding In-Person programming, yes XYZ can be on-site during those days. Travel & expenses will be charged to you at cost. However, we will conduct individual IDI debriefs virtually to allow for greater flexibility around your staff scheduling needs.\r\n\r\nRegarding locking in those dates, as for now, our calendar has availability. Keep in mind we cannot secure the dates until we have a signed statement of work.\r\n\r\nIf the attached proposal meets your approval, we will connect you with a consultant and begin the work of finalizing the details of your program.\r\n\r\n<URL><<URL>>\r\n\r\nLooking forward to your response!",

We would be interested in phase 1 with BCI learning since I do think having some follow up learning is important - in looking at the Phase 1 proposals, the proposal for phase 1 with the BCI does not include the two group debriefs. Is this something that we can include in the proposal?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFor the group debriefs, we are aiming to do this in the first week of October in-person, ideally for our JEDI Council on Monday 10/2 and the Leadership Team on Tuesday 10/3. Could you confirm that we would be able to have this facilitated by XYZ in person? Would travel expenses for the facilitators be at cost?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCould you also remind me of the timing/order of how this takes place? First, we would have the group debriefs, then we would ask individuals to complete the assessment and then we would do the BCI session? What is your recommendation for timing in between the group debrief, individual debriefs and the BCI learning? Given our group size and purpose of the JEDI Council and Leadership Team, would the recommendation be to do separate BCI sessions?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI know I threw out a lot of questions so please let me know if it's best to jump on a call to discuss!",

        "body": "Hi <PERSON>,\r\nHope you\u2019re having a great week! For the proposal for BCI, we agree that based on your given group size, the best option moving forward would be to hold two separate BCI sessions that include IDI Group Debriefs for the JEDI Counsel and the Leadership Team.\r\nRecommended Option: Two BCI sessions, where two group IDI debriefs are included.\r\n\r\n  *   Timeline, starting with individual IDI assessments & individual coaching.\r\n\r\n     *   Participants should take the assessment and participate in the individual debrief before 9/15, allowing ample time for the consultant to build the group\u2019s aggregate results in the BCI program.\r\n\r\n  *   BCI sessions on October 2nd & 3rd.\r\nWe recommend doing the individual debriefs before you go into a group setting to receive the aggregate results. Doing the IDI assessment and debriefs first helps individuals since they\u2019ll know where they individually sit on the continuum in advance and can find some solidarity in understanding they are not alone in the process. Participants also have a better understanding of what the group dynamic could represent because of the insights from the IDI debrief and their contributions to that group.\r\nAs for your question regarding In-Person programming, yes XYZ can be on-site during those days. Travel & expenses will be charged to you at cost. However, we will conduct individual IDI debriefs virtually to allow for greater flexibility around your staff scheduling needs.\r\nRegarding locking in those dates, as for now, our calendar has availability. Keep in mind we cannot secure the dates until we have a signed statement of work.\r\nIf the attached proposal meets your approval, we will connect you with a consultant and begin the work of finalizing the details of your program.\r\n<URL><<URL>>\r\nLooking forward to your response!",

        "body": "Hi <PERSON>,\r\n\r\nHope you\u2019re having a great week! For the proposal for BCI, we agree that based on your given group size, the best option moving forward would be to hold two separate BCI sessions that include IDI Group Debriefs for the JEDI Counsel and the Leadership Team.\r\n\r\nRecommended Option: Two BCI sessions, where two group IDI debriefs are included.\r\n\r\n  *   Timeline, starting with individual IDI assessments & individual coaching.\r\n\r\n     *   Participants should take the assessment and participate in the individual debrief before 9/15, allowing ample time for the consultant to build the group\u2019s aggregate results in the BCI program.\r\n\r\n  *   BCI sessions on October 2nd & 3rd.\r\n\r\nWe recommend doing the individual debriefs before you go into a group setting to receive the aggregate results. Doing the IDI assessment and debriefs first helps individuals since they\u2019ll know where they individually sit on the continuum in advance and can find some solidarity in understanding they are not alone in the process. Participants also have a better understanding of what the group dynamic could represent because of the insights from the IDI debrief and their contributions to that group.\r\n\r\nAs for your question regarding In-Person programming, yes XYZ can be on-site during those days. Travel & expenses will be charged to you at cost. However, we will conduct individual IDI debriefs virtually to allow for greater flexibility around your staff scheduling needs.\r\n\r\nRegarding locking in those dates, as for now, our calendar has availability. Keep in mind we cannot secure the dates until we have a signed statement of work.\r\n\r\nIf the attached proposal meets your approval, we will connect you with a consultant and begin the work of finalizing the details of your program.\r\n\r\n<URL>\r\n\r\nLooking forward to your response!",

I\u2019m definitely looking forward to meeting you soon and as I mentioned to you initially, <PERSON>, I have a soft spot for <LOCATION> products above all other skincare/cosmetics brands because of my good friend who for years did internal training in <LOCATION>/<LOCATION>. I remember back when <PERSON> was y\u2019all\u2019s spokesperson and she got to meet her  -that was certainly exciting!

        "body": "Dear <PERSON> and <PERSON>,\r\n\r\nHope you are well and enjoying the last remnants of summer. As we are pulling together a proposal for you, we wanted to check in and see how you felt the demo went with <PERSON> and <PERSON> and ask a couple of clarification questions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYou discussed the importance of ensuring the content included research and data as your targeted audience was financially/data savvy as well as ensuring content was relevant to your creative/ marketing focused audience.  You are also a global organization with a comprehensive DEI curriculum already.\r\n\r\n  1.  How do you envision this rollout?  That is, you mentioned an initial session with your creative group of approximately 40 people. First, is this correct? Second, confirming your creative team refers to Est\u00e9e Lauder\u2019s Marketing team? And finally, do you envision further rollouts and if so could you add some clarity around target audiences?\r\n  2.  Will this be a global rollout? As you saw during the demo, this workshop is focused on the <LOCATION> experience, and if you are considering a global rollout, we would want to make adjustments to be inclusive of the Black experience in different regions and countries. If a global rollout, with which countries so that we can ensure we are geographically inclusive in our content?  Any additional thoughts on this are greatly appreciated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<PERSON> is now back from her much- deserved vacation.  She leads our content and business development functions and will be working with <PERSON> to pull things together for you as a next step. If it's easier, we are happy to jump on a quick call with you.  Would love to get your feedback.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLooking forward to next steps,\r\n\r\nDeb\r\n\r\n________________________________",

We have a lot of experience navigating hard questions and pushback during deliveries.\r\n\r\nSeparately \u2013 but related \u2013 if you\u2019re ever in need for cultural literacy education for people managers, we offer this very effective program:\r\n\r\nDeveloping Inclusively: What You Need to Know About Your Black Talent\r\nThis engaging and practical workshop engages with questions like: Where is the African American/Black talent sitting in your organization? How are you ensuring this talent has access to the opportunities, relationships, and networks needed to advance? In this session, people managers are guided through a journey to broaden cultural competency and better understand the experience of their Black employees, so they can create better action plans that will retain and develop this population. Participants reflect on how they and their peers may be contributing to experiences positively and negatively, then practice what they can do better and differently on an organizational level and as leaders.\r\n\r\nGood luck with everything and we look forward to another opportunity to work together!\r\n\r\n<PERSON>\r\n(she/her)\r\nHead of Business Development\r\nXYZ",

Thank you for meeting with us last week and sharing your insight on ways we could collaborate to continue to drive inclusion and cultural competence within Est\u00e9e Lauder.\r\n\r\nAttached are:\r\n\r\n  1.  A three-workshop curriculum to upskill Est\u00e9e Lauder staff on Black/African American cultural competence and inclusion:\r\n\r\n  *   \u201cUnderstanding The Black Experience\u201d (UTBE) Cultural Immersion (which we talked about extensively during our meeting)\r\n  *   \u201cUpskilling Your Ally Voice\u201d is a \u2018part 2\u2019 to the Immersion and gives people a forum to practice answering and addressing frequently asked questions about the Black community. Facilitators provide coaching and feedback, and participants are able to practice having these conversations in a judgment-free, growth-mindset environment, so they can then transfer this skill to their day-to-day. This one\u2019s also facilitated by a <NRP> facilitator and a non-Black Ally.\r\n  *   \u201cDeveloping Inclusively: What You Need to Know About Black Talent\u201d is a 3-hour workshop for people managers, to help upskill them on what their Black team members need to develop and advance within the organization.\r\n\r\n\r\n  1.  A slide that gives you an overview of our facilitated and digital learning solutions. Please let us know if any of these fill a gap for you and we would be more than happy to send you more information about particular workshops or tools.\r\n\r\nPlease feel free to share these documents internally with your stakeholders.\r\n\r\nWe would also like to schedule a demo for our Black Experience Cultural Immersion.  Here are times we have for next week, where our Lead Facilitator <PERSON><<URL>>, would be able to demo the UTBE session for 45 mins:\r\n\r\n\r\n  *   Wednesday, September 6th at 11am, 12pm, 3pm, or 4pm EST\r\n  *   Thursday, September 7th at 9am, 12:30pm, 1pm, or 2pm EST\r\n\r\nLet me know if any of these times work for you, and I\u2019ll send an invite accordingly.\r\n\r\nLooking forward to your response!",

I dont know many orgs that have this particular focus and depth as we <URL>so, in reviewing the UBE demo we are scheduling, I think the intent v impact is fine since it has a nice combo of breakout/interaction and speaks to the marketing/imagery- two things they mentioned are important. \u00a0I would note a few things to prepare for the demo:they mentioned their global nature, so lets ensure we arent too NA/<LOCATION> focused. \u00a0if we can have a global example, scenario to talk through, that would resonatethey mentioned data/numbers, research resonates with their population so citing data/research will also largely resonate. \u00a0e.g. dollars lost from ads or gained from strong ads/imagery/DEI intentionalityfocus on the \"applicability/behavior change and outcome of the intent v impact sessionHope thats <LOCATION>",

Examples of DEI initiatives you shared with us include education around unconscious bias and  microaggressions, the large number of inclusion-minded volunteers at <PERSON>, as well as an upcoming guest speaker series for your C-suite and director level and above leaders. We also admire the creativity, collaboration and generosity underpinning how your relatively new DEI Team is coming together and driving momentum throughout the organization. We felt your \u2018family approach\u2019 \u2013 interdependent, got each other\u2019s backs, \u2018all for one\u2019 scrappiness in embedding DEI within <PERSON>\u2019s culture and businesses.\r\nWe\u2019d be delighted and proud to partner with you, starting with administrating the Intercultural Development Inventory\u00ae (IDI) for your division Presidents and their teams, as well as for <PERSON>\u2019s HR professionals. I\u2019ve personally found the IDI to be an incredibly effective, compelling and galvanizing tool when it comes to talking about and advancing inclusion, equity, and belonging - especially for people leaders. And it\u2019s great that you have a champion for it in <PERSON>, who has taken it in the past.\r\nOur approach would be framing the IDI initiative around <PERSON>'s specific DEI objective/s and context, and guiding intercultural competence development and momentum towards achieving those goals \u2013 always being as specific and action-oriented as possible. We\u2019ll work with you to determine the communication plan and \u2018onboarding\u2019 into this project for your constituents, and thoroughly prepare all IDI coaches on our end before each leader\u2019s debrief as well as the Group Debriefs.\r\nPlease find our proposal for IDIs for <LOCATION>-based leaders here --> <URL><<URL>>\r\nIn addition, below we\u2019ve included information and costs for additional learning interventions by constituent group (both workshops and digital tools) that may fit into your plans in the future.\r\nWe can of course work with you on cost for packages of multiple workshops.\r\n\r\n<PERSON>, <PERSON>, and <PERSON> - if the above and below are only almost right for your needs, then we look forward to hearing from you so that we can respond swiftly, make adjustments, and get you what you need to ensure alignment.\r\n\r\nHave a good rest of your week and we\u2019ll touch base next week if we don\u2019t hear from you first!",

Helping you develop and implement a restorative practice within your HR employee issue-resolution process and\r\n  2.  Increasing intercultural competency and inclusive leadership skills as well as broadening the diversity of your leadership team.\r\nGuide for Restorative HR Conversations\r\nAs you know, the restorative process/practice is aimed at repairing and fostering relationships, in a way that benefits the employees as well as the organization. It works to understand what each employes needs to be 'restored' in the relationship, and return to healing and working effectively with one another.\r\nThe restorative practice takes the focus away from guilt and punishment, and would seek to repair harm by:\r\n\r\n  1.  Agreeing on the facts of what happened (the facts on what was said, done)\r\n  2.  Providing an opportunity for the aggrieved employee/s to talk about their perception of what happened, and the impact it had on them\r\n  3.  Providing and opportunity for the employee/s who perpetrated the harm to talk about their perception of what happened, distinguish between intent and impact, and take responsibility for the harm\r\n  4.  Addressing the needs of all employees impacted by the conflict/disagreement/incident/dispute, and\r\n  5.  Providing an opportunity for all parties to come up with a path forward that makes them feel heard and whole (however many meetings or conversations it takes).\r\nWe recommend that <PERSON> leverage XYZ's Describe-Interepret-Navigate, or DIN, model within the process (please see attached).\r\nThis process will require careful change management, co-development of the restorative HR process at <PERSON>, training on the restorative process for HR, and development of an onboarding/comms process for <PERSON> employees.\r\nThe process itself should have ground rules for conversation that all parties agree to at the outset, to encourage brave conversations and establish a psychologically safe 'container' - an environment that promotes trust, mutual respect, and safety around interpersonal risk-taking, where people don't feel afraid to speak up for fear of being embarrassed, rejected or dismissed. Ground rules would include things like: being open to resolving the issue, assuming positive intent/good faith from the other person (foundational rule, without this the process will not work), mindful listening, limited or managed interjections/interruptions, acknowledging relative levels of power and privilege in the room (both formal titles and informal relationships/relational privilege, and ensuring that any judgments and evaluations are backed up by specific behaviors and examples.\r\nWe propose co-developing a Guide for Restorative HR Conversations, where we can do some more listening around your needs and preferences, build a first draft for you, then have you review it and provide us with feedback. This would be a consulting project for us, and we are estimating about 16 hours (two days) of work and 2 review cycles, which is what the project fee reflects.\r\nIntercultural Development Inventory(r)\r\nWe recommend that you start with administrating the Intercultural Development Inventory(r) (IDI) for your leadership team, future HR Manager, and HR Assistant. I've personally found the IDI to be an incredibly effective, compelling and galvanizing tool when it comes to talking about and advancing inclusion, equity, and belonging - and hearing and understanding each other better. Its focus is on mindsets - and engaging in restorative HR takes a shift in mindset. Most conflict stems from 'cultural' differences - meaning differences around how we've been taught to interact, communicate, work, and 'be' - by our families, contexts and experiences growing up and beyond, our experiences belonging to our ethnicity/race, nationality, gender, socioeconomic & educational background, religion, previous jobs and schools, etc. Misinterpretations and differences in interpretations caused by these cultural differences account for the vast majority of conflicts that we find ourselves in! And we can provide language for you to talk about these differences too - confidently and knowledgeably.\r\nEach person would take the 50-item IDI assessment. Then, they could each receive either:\r\n\r\n  *   A one-hour virtual individual debrief, where an IDI Qualified Administrator (QA) would walk them through their results, unpack what they mean, and get them to articulate an action plan, and/ or\r\n  *   A Group Debrief of collective results, a 2-hour workshop facilitated by us, where the group has space to dialogue about the IDI experience, the meaning of inclusive leadership, unpack the implications of their group result, and learn about additional strategies they can take to live into the intercultural/inclusive mindsets of the IDI. (Individual profiles are not available if you choose only this option).\r\nOur approach would be framing the IDI initiative around <PERSON>'s specific objectives around restorative HR (and also around inclusion, diversity, and equity generally at <PERSON>).  We'll work with you to determine the communication plan and 'onboarding' into this project for your folks, and prepare our IDI coaches on our end before each leader's debrief as well as the Group Debriefs.\r\nOur proposal reflects both individual debriefs and a Group Debrief.\r\n\r\nPlease find our proposal for the above here --> XYZ's Proposal for <PERSON><<URL>>  Please note at the bottom we've applied a 20% non-profit discount.\r\nIn addition, below we've included information and costs for additional learning interventions (both workshops and digital tools), most of which we mentioned during our meeting, which may fit into your plans in the future.\r\nWe can of course work with you on cost for packages of multiple workshops.\r\n\r\n<PERSON> and <PERSON> - if the above and below are only almost right for your needs, then we look forward to hearing from you so that we can respond swiftly, make adjustments, and get you what you need to ensure alignment.\r\n\r\nHave a good Thursday and we'll touch base next week if we don't hear from you first!",

Ground rules would include things like: being open to resolving the issue, assuming positive intent/good faith from the other person (foundational rule, without this the process will not work), mindful listening, limited or managed interjections/interruptions, acknowledging relative levels of power and privilege in the room (both formal titles and informal relationships/relational privilege, and ensuring that any judgments and evaluations are backed up by specific behaviors and examples.\r\nWe propose co-developing a Guide for Restorative HR Conversations, where we can do some more listening around your needs and preferences, build a first draft for you, then have you review it and provide us with feedback. This would be a consulting project for us, and we are estimating about 16 hours (two days) of work and 2 review cycles, which is what the project fee reflects.\r\nIntercultural Development Inventory\u00ae\r\nWe recommend that you start with administrating the Intercultural Development Inventory\u00ae (IDI) for your leadership team, future HR Manager, and HR Assistant. I\u2019ve personally found the IDI to be an incredibly effective, compelling and galvanizing tool when it comes to talking about and advancing inclusion, equity, and belonging \u2013 and hearing and understanding each other better. Its focus is on mindsets \u2013 and engaging in restorative HR takes a shift in mindset. Most conflict stems from \u2018cultural\u2019 differences \u2013 meaning differences around how we\u2019ve been taught to interact, communicate, work, and \u2018be\u2019 \u2013 by our families, contexts and experiences growing up and beyond, our experiences belonging to our ethnicity/race, nationality, gender, socioeconomic & educational background, religion, previous jobs and schools, etc. Misinterpretations and differences in interpretations caused by these cultural differences account for the vast majority of conflicts that we find ourselves in! And we can provide language for you to talk about these differences too \u2013 confidently and knowledgeably.\r\nEach person would take the 50-item IDI assessment. Then, they could each receive either:\r\n\r\n  *   A one-hour virtual individual debrief, where an IDI Qualified Administrator (QA) would walk them through their results, unpack what they mean, and get them to articulate an action plan, and/ or\r\n  *   A Group Debrief of collective results, a 2-hour workshop facilitated by us, where the group has space to dialogue about the IDI experience, the meaning of inclusive leadership, unpack the implications of their group result, and learn about additional strategies they can take to live into the intercultural/inclusive mindsets of the IDI. (Individual profiles are not available if you choose only this option).\r\nOur approach would be framing the IDI initiative around <PERSON>'s specific objectives around restorative HR (and also around inclusion, diversity, and equity generally at <PERSON>).  We\u2019ll work with you to determine the communication plan and \u2018onboarding\u2019 into this project for your folks, and prepare our IDI coaches on our end before each leader\u2019s debrief as well as the Group Debriefs.\r\nOur proposal reflects both individual debriefs and a Group Debrief.\r\n\r\nPlease find our proposal for the above here --> XYZ\u2019s Proposal for <PERSON><<URL>>  Please note at the bottom we\u2019ve applied a 20% non-profit discount.\r\nIn addition, below we\u2019ve included information and costs for additional learning interventions (both workshops and digital tools), most of which we mentioned during our meeting, which may fit into your plans in the future.\r\nWe can of course work with you on cost for packages of multiple workshops.\r\n\r\n<PERSON> and <PERSON> - if the above and below are only almost right for your needs, then we look forward to hearing from you so that we can respond swiftly, make adjustments, and get you what you need to ensure alignment.\r\n\r\nHave a good Thursday and we\u2019ll touch base next week if we don\u2019t hear from you first!",

Helping you develop and implement a restorative practice within your HR employee issue-resolution process and\r\n  2.  Increasing intercultural competency and inclusive leadership skills as well as broadening the diversity of your leadership team.\r\nGuide for Restorative HR Conversations\r\nAs you know, the restorative process/practice is aimed at repairing and fostering relationships, in a way that benefits the employees as well as the organization. It works to understand what each employes needs to be 'restored' in the relationship, and return to healing and working effectively with one another.\r\nThe restorative practice takes the focus away from guilt and punishment, and would seek to repair harm by:\r\n\r\n  1.  Agreeing on the facts of what happened (the facts on what was said, done)\r\n  2.  Providing an opportunity for the aggrieved employee/s to talk about their perception of what happened, and the impact it had on them\r\n  3.  Providing and opportunity for the employee/s who perpetrated the harm to talk about their perception of what happened, distinguish between intent and impact, and take responsibility for the harm\r\n  4.  Addressing the needs of all employees impacted by the conflict/disagreement/incident/dispute, and\r\n  5.  Providing an opportunity for all parties to come up with a path forward that makes them feel heard and whole (however many meetings or conversations it takes).\r\nWe recommend that <PERSON> leverage XYZ's Describe-Interepret-Navigate, or DIN, model within the process (please see attached).\r\nThis process will require careful change management, co-development of the restorative HR process at <PERSON>, training on the restorative process for HR, and development of an onboarding/comms process for <PERSON> employees.\r\nThe process itself should have ground rules for conversation that all parties agree to at the outset, to encourage brave conversations and establish a psychologically safe 'container' - an environment that promotes trust, mutual respect, and safety around interpersonal risk-taking, where people don't feel afraid to speak up for fear of being embarrassed, rejected or dismissed.

HRCI offers some certificates in Diversity and Inclusion, but I have not seen any materials on restorative practices.\r\n\r\nPlease let me know if I can provide any additional information.\r\n\r\nThank you and have a great weekend!\r\n<PERSON>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[A picture containing text, font, poster, screenshot  Description automatically generated]\r\n<PERSON>, MBA, SHRM-CP, PHR\r\nChief Operating Officer\r\nShe/Her/Hers\r\n\r\n[cid:<URL>g@01D9F547.4182BAF0]  <PHONE_NUMBER> x 102\r\n[cid:<URL>g@01D9F547.4182BAF0]  <PHONE_NUMBER>\r\n\r\n<PERSON>\r\n300 <LOCATION>\r\nSuite 300\r\n<LOCATION>, RI 02888",

Do not click links or open attachments unless you recognize the sender and know the content is safe.\r\n\r\n\r\n[cid:<URL>g@<URL>4E61D0]\r\n\r\nHello <PERSON> and <PERSON> -\r\n\r\nThank you so much for reaching out to us, and for the time you took to give us an overview of your wonderful organization and your people-related/DEI goals.\r\nWe'd be delighted and proud to partner with you!\r\nI see a great fit with regards to the second and third goals you outlined for us:\r\n\r\n  1.  Helping you develop and implement a restorative practice within your HR employee issue-resolution process and\r\n  2.  Increasing intercultural competency and inclusive leadership skills as well as broadening the diversity of your leadership team.\r\nGuide for Restorative HR Conversations\r\nAs you know, the restorative process/practice is aimed at repairing and fostering relationships, in a way that benefits the employees as well as the organization. It works to understand what each employes needs to be 'restored' in the relationship, and return to healing and working effectively with one another.\r\nThe restorative practice takes the focus away from guilt and punishment, and would seek to repair harm by:\r\n\r\n  1.  Agreeing on the facts of what happened (the facts on what was said, done)\r\n  2.  Providing an opportunity for the aggrieved employee/s to talk about their perception of what happened, and the impact it had on them\r\n  3.  Providing and opportunity for the employee/s who perpetrated the harm to talk about their perception of what happened, distinguish between intent and impact, and take responsibility for the harm\r\n  4.  Addressing the needs of all employees impacted by the conflict/disagreement/incident/dispute, and\r\n  5.  Providing an opportunity for all parties to come up with a path forward that makes them feel heard and whole (however many meetings or conversations it takes).\r\nWe recommend that <PERSON> leverage XYZ's Describe-Interepret-Navigate, or DIN, model within the process (please see attached).\r\nThis process will require careful change management, co-development of the restorative HR process at <PERSON>, training on the restorative process for HR, and development of an onboarding/comms process for <PERSON> employees.\r\nThe process itself should have ground rules for conversation that all parties agree to at the outset, to encourage brave conversations and establish a psychologically safe 'container' - an environment that promotes trust, mutual respect, and safety around interpersonal risk-taking, where people don't feel afraid to speak up for fear of being embarrassed, rejected or dismissed. Ground rules would include things like: being open to resolving the issue, assuming positive intent/good faith from the other person (foundational rule, without this the process will not work), mindful listening, limited or managed interjections/interruptions, acknowledging relative levels of power and privilege in the room (both formal titles and informal relationships/relational privilege, and ensuring that any judgments and evaluations are backed up by specific behaviors and examples.\r\nWe propose co-developing a Guide for Restorative HR Conversations, where we can do some more listening around your needs and preferences, build a first draft for you, then have you review it and provide us with feedback. This would be a consulting project for us, and we are estimating about 16 hours (two days) of work and 2 review cycles, which is what the project fee reflects.\r\nIntercultural Development Inventory\u00ae\r\nWe recommend that you start with administrating the Intercultural Development Inventory\u00ae (IDI) for your leadership team, future HR Manager, and HR Assistant. I've personally found the IDI to be an incredibly effective, compelling and galvanizing tool when it comes to talking about and advancing inclusion, equity, and belonging - and hearing and understanding each other better. Its focus is on mindsets - and engaging in restorative HR takes a shift in mindset. Most conflict stems from 'cultural' differences - meaning differences around how we've been taught to interact, communicate, work, and 'be' - by our families, contexts and experiences growing up and beyond, our experiences belonging to our ethnicity/race, nationality, gender, socioeconomic & educational background, religion, previous jobs and schools, etc. Misinterpretations and differences in interpretations caused by these cultural differences account for the vast majority of conflicts that we find ourselves in! And we can provide language for you to talk about these differences too - confidently and knowledgeably.\r\nEach person would take the 50-item IDI assessment. Then, they could each receive either:\r\n\r\n  *   A one-hour virtual individual debrief, where an IDI Qualified Administrator (QA) would walk them through their results, unpack what they mean, and get them to articulate an action plan, and/ or\r\n  *   A Group Debrief of collective results, a 2-hour workshop facilitated by us, where the group has space to dialogue about the IDI experience, the meaning of inclusive leadership, unpack the implications of their group result, and learn about additional strategies they can take to live into the intercultural/inclusive mindsets of the IDI. (Individual profiles are not available if you choose only this option).\r\nOur approach would be framing the IDI initiative around <PERSON>'s specific objectives around restorative HR (and also around inclusion, diversity, and equity generally at <PERSON>).  We'll work with you to determine the communication plan and 'onboarding' into this project for your folks, and prepare our IDI coaches on our end before each leader's debrief as well as the Group Debriefs.\r\nOur proposal reflects both individual debriefs and a Group Debrief.\r\n\r\nPlease find our proposal for the above here --> XYZ's Proposal for <PERSON><<URL>>  Please note at the bottom we've applied a 20% non-profit discount.\r\nIn addition, below we've included information and costs for additional learning interventions (both workshops and digital tools), most of which we mentioned during our meeting, which may fit into your plans in the future.\r\nWe can of course work with you on cost for packages of multiple workshops.\r\n\r\n<PERSON> and <PERSON> - if the above and below are only almost right for your needs, then we look forward to hearing from you so that we can respond swiftly, make adjustments, and get you what you need to ensure alignment.\r\n\r\nHave a good Thursday and we'll touch base next week if we don't hear from you first!",

Helping you develop and implement a restorative practice within your HR employee issue-resolution process and\r\n  2.  Increasing intercultural competency and inclusive leadership skills as well as broadening the diversity of your leadership team.\r\nGuide for Restorative HR Conversations\r\nAs you know, the restorative process/practice is aimed at repairing and fostering relationships, in a way that benefits the employees as well as the organization. It works to understand what each employes needs to be \u2018restored\u2019 in the relationship, and return to healing and working effectively with one another.\r\nThe restorative practice takes the focus away from guilt and punishment, and would seek to repair harm by:\r\n\r\n  1.  Agreeing on the facts of what happened (the facts on what was said, done)\r\n  2.  Providing an opportunity for the aggrieved employee/s to talk about their perception of what happened, and the impact it had on them\r\n  3.  Providing and opportunity for the employee/s who perpetrated the harm to talk about their perception of what happened, distinguish between intent and impact, and take responsibility for the harm\r\n  4.  Addressing the needs of all employees impacted by the conflict/disagreement/incident/dispute, and\r\n  5.  Providing an opportunity for all parties to come up with a path forward that makes them feel heard and whole (however many meetings or conversations it takes).\r\nWe recommend that <PERSON> leverage XYZ\u2019s Describe-Interepret-Navigate, or DIN, model within the process (please see attached).\r\nThis process will require careful change management, co-development of the restorative HR process at <PERSON>, training on the restorative process for HR, and development of an onboarding/comms process for <PERSON> employees.\r\nThe process itself should have ground rules for conversation that all parties agree to at the outset, to encourage brave conversations and establish a psychologically safe \u2018container\u2019 \u2013 an environment that promotes trust, mutual respect, and safety around interpersonal risk-taking, where people don\u2019t feel afraid to speak up for fear of being embarrassed, rejected or dismissed. Ground rules would include things like: being open to resolving the issue, assuming positive intent/good faith from the other person (foundational rule, without this the process will not work), mindful listening, limited or managed interjections/interruptions, acknowledging relative levels of power and privilege in the room (both formal titles and informal relationships/relational privilege, and ensuring that any judgments and evaluations are backed up by specific behaviors and examples.\r\nWe propose co-developing a Guide for Restorative HR Conversations, where we can do some more listening around your needs and preferences, build a first draft for you, then have you review it and provide us with feedback. This would be a consulting project for us, and we are estimating about 16 hours (two days) of work and 2 review cycles, which is what the project fee reflects.\r\nIntercultural Development Inventory\u00ae\r\nWe recommend that you start with administrating the Intercultural Development Inventory\u00ae (IDI) for your leadership team, future HR Manager, and HR Assistant. I\u2019ve personally found the IDI to be an incredibly effective, compelling and galvanizing tool when it comes to talking about and advancing inclusion, equity, and belonging \u2013 and hearing and understanding each other better. Its focus is on mindsets \u2013 and engaging in restorative HR takes a shift in mindset. Most conflict stems from \u2018cultural\u2019 differences \u2013 meaning differences around how we\u2019ve been taught to interact, communicate, work, and \u2018be\u2019 \u2013 by our families, contexts and experiences growing up and beyond, our experiences belonging to our ethnicity/race, nationality, gender, socioeconomic & educational background, religion, previous jobs and schools, etc. Misinterpretations and differences in interpretations caused by these cultural differences account for the vast majority of conflicts that we find ourselves in! And we can provide language for you to talk about these differences too \u2013 confidently and knowledgeably.\r\nEach person would take the 50-item IDI assessment. Then, they could each receive either:\r\n\r\n  *   A one-hour virtual individual debrief, where an IDI Qualified Administrator (QA) would walk them through their results, unpack what they mean, and get them to articulate an action plan, and/ or\r\n  *   A Group Debrief of collective results, a 2-hour workshop facilitated by us, where the group has space to dialogue about the IDI experience, the meaning of inclusive leadership, unpack the implications of their group result, and learn about additional strategies they can take to live into the intercultural/inclusive mindsets of the IDI. (Individual profiles are not available if you choose only this option).\r\nOur approach would be framing the IDI initiative around <PERSON>'s specific objectives around restorative HR (and also around inclusion, diversity, and equity generally at <PERSON>).  We\u2019ll work with you to determine the communication plan and \u2018onboarding\u2019 into this project for your folks, and prepare our IDI coaches on our end before each leader\u2019s debrief as well as the Group Debriefs.\r\nOur proposal reflects both individual debriefs and a Group Debrief.\r\n\r\nPlease find our proposal for the above here --> XYZ\u2019s Proposal for <PERSON><<URL>>  Please note at the bottom we\u2019ve applied a 20% non-profit discount.\r\nIn addition, below we\u2019ve included information and costs for additional learning interventions (both workshops and digital tools), most of which we mentioned during our meeting, which may fit into your plans in the future.\r\nWe can of course work with you on cost for packages of multiple workshops.\r\n\r\n<PERSON> and <PERSON> - if the above and below are only almost right for your needs, then we look forward to hearing from you so that we can respond swiftly, make adjustments, and get you what you need to ensure alignment.\r\n\r\nHave a good Thursday and we\u2019ll touch base next week if we don\u2019t hear from you first!",

And we can provide language for you to talk about these differences too - confidently and knowledgeably.\r\nEach person would take the 50-item IDI assessment. Then, they could each receive either:\r\n\r\n  *   A one-hour virtual individual debrief, where an IDI Qualified Administrator (QA) would walk them through their results, unpack what they mean, and get them to articulate an action plan, and/ or\r\n  *   A Group Debrief of collective results, a 2-hour workshop facilitated by us, where the group has space to dialogue about the IDI experience, the meaning of inclusive leadership, unpack the implications of their group result, and learn about additional strategies they can take to live into the intercultural/inclusive mindsets of the IDI. (Individual profiles are not available if you choose only this option).\r\nOur approach would be framing the IDI initiative around <PERSON>'s specific objectives around restorative HR (and also around inclusion, diversity, and equity generally at <PERSON>).  We'll work with you to determine the communication plan and 'onboarding' into this project for your folks, and prepare our IDI coaches on our end before each leader's debrief as well as the Group Debriefs.\r\nOur proposal reflects both individual debriefs and a Group Debrief.\r\n\r\nPlease find our proposal for the above here --> XYZ's Proposal for <PERSON><<URL>>  Please note at the bottom we've applied a 20% non-profit discount.\r\nIn addition, below we've included information and costs for additional learning interventions (both workshops and digital tools), most of which we mentioned during our meeting, which may fit into your plans in the future.\r\nWe can of course work with you on cost for packages of multiple workshops.\r\n\r\n<PERSON> and <PERSON> - if the above and below are only almost right for your needs, then we look forward to hearing from you so that we can respond swiftly, make adjustments, and get you what you need to ensure alignment.\r\n\r\nHave a good Thursday and we'll touch base next week if we don't hear from you first!",

UB 101 - confirming you're referring to our \"Intro to Managing UB\" eLearning module, yes? Which by the way was updated and it looks even better now. So, 9,000 seats.

Topics include: Identifying <PERSON>, Microinequities/Microaggressions, and Unstereotyping.\r\n  3.  Two microlearning modules: Managing <PERSON> in Interviews and Managing Bias in Talent Review. As you saw in the demo link, our microlearnings now come as a single digital module with video/job aid embedded (no longer two separate things).

Through examples, discussion, and self-exploration, participants will discover the difference between an ally and an advocate, learn tips and skills for becoming a better ally, and consider actions they can take right away - and every day - to advocate for underrepresented or marginalized people and communities.\r\nOther topics covered include:\r\n\r\n  *   Why allies matter\r\n  *   How to turn your insights into action\r\n  *   How to \"call in\" and challenge microaggressions\r\n  *   Six roles you can play as an ally\r\n  *   <NRP> allyship\r\n  *   Responsibilities of an ally\r\n\r\nPlease lmk when/if you'd like to move forward, and we can get an SOW started for you\r\n\r\nThanks, JG! <PERSON><PERSON>\r\n(she/her)\r\nHead of Business Development\r\nXYZ\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInternal",

[Image removed by sender. ?]\r\n\r\nI've put together a proposal for you that reflects:\r\n\r\n  1.  Annual subscription to \"Introduction to Managing Unconscious Bias\" eLearning\r\n  2.  Annual subscription to \"Managing Bias in Interviewing\" and \"Managing Bias in Talent Review\" MicroLearnings,\r\n  3.  Translations for everything.\r\n\r\nI used the 9,000 seats for the eLearning and 2,500 seats (people managers) for each of the two microLearnings.

I don't mean to sound like a used car salesperson but it's actually true!

Annual subscription to \"Introduction to Managing Unconscious Bias\" eLearning\r\n  2.  Annual subscription to \"Managing Bias in Interviewing\" and \"Managing Bias in Talent Review\" MicroLearnings,\r\n  3.  Translations for everything.\r\n\r\nI used the 9,000 seats for the eLearning and 2,500 seats (people managers) for each of the two microLearnings. All of the tools have been updated and refreshed since the last time you saw them at JNJ.\r\n\r\nI can honestly say we're providing \"rock bottom\" pricing for you here, I worked with the product managers and <PERSON> to pretty much provide them to you at cost. I don't mean to sound like a used car salesperson but it's actually true!

These programs also require deep intercultural competence skillsets.\r\n\r\nFinally, content for both the <PERSON> and Spotlights are updated regularly, at least annually, to recognize the current times.\r\n\r\nThus for the reasons stated above, immersions and Spotlights we typically do not offer TTT options.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRe: baseline on culture/ethnicity--\r\n\r\nYes, we do have a one-hour session we call Foundations of Diversity and Inclusion, which introduces the concepts of diversity, inclusion, and culture. It differentiates between diversity and inclusion, touches on the powerful role that culture plays in driving behavior and expectations in the workplace (ethnicity being one of those cultures), and offers examples of day-to-day actions which could contribute towards a sense of disengagement or lack of belonging. Examples of inclusive everyday behaviors are also provided, and an opportunity to brainstorm what you would do to practice inclusion through short scenarios. For this one we could certainly conduct a TTT.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe also offer a program called \u201cBuilding a Culture of Inclusion\u201d, which goes deeper into intercultural competence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease let me know what else we can clarify for you.",

        "body": "Hi <PERSON>,\r\n\r\nThanks for the questions.\r\n\r\nRe: Train the Trainer \u2013\r\nThe half day cultural immersions require 2 facilitators (one member of the culture and one nonmember/ally) and the material requires highly specialized skillsets from both.\r\nThe identity-specific Spotlights also require facilitation by a member of the community, who is leveraging their identity to facilitate. These programs also require deep intercultural competence skillsets.\r\nFinally, content for both the <PERSON> and Spotlights are updated regularly, at least annually, to recognize the current times.\r\nThus for the reasons stated above, immersions and Spotlights we typically do not offer TTT options.\r\n\r\nRe: baseline on culture/ethnicity--\r\nYes, we do have a one-hour session we call Foundations of Diversity and Inclusion, which introduces the concepts of diversity, inclusion, and culture. It differentiates between diversity and inclusion, touches on the powerful role that culture plays in driving behavior and expectations in the workplace (ethnicity being one of those cultures), and offers examples of day-to-day actions which could contribute towards a sense of disengagement or lack of belonging. Examples of inclusive everyday behaviors are also provided, and an opportunity to brainstorm what you would do to practice inclusion through short scenarios. For this one we could certainly conduct a TTT.\r\n\r\nWe also offer a program called \u201cBuilding a Culture of Inclusion\u201d, which goes deeper into intercultural competence.\r\n\r\nPlease let me know what else we can clarify for you.",

Just a thought.\r\n\r\nLooking forward to it,\r\n<PERSON>",

Have a good weekend! <PERSON> and <PERSON>\r\n\r\nLet\u2019s Talk Talent: Examining the Talent Lifecycle Through an Intercultural Competence Lens (75 min: 1-hr presentation & 15 min Q&A)\r\nJoin us for a session that will give you an overview of what it takes to build and maintain a sustainable culture of inclusion throughout your Talent Processes. XYZ\u2019s Sustainable Culture of Inclusion (SCI) Model is a framework for understanding what \u201csuccess across cultures\u201d looks like as well as a roadmap for creating it. Its grounding premise is that a sustainable, inclusive culture exists when there is: (a) a critical mass of people (especially leaders) with mindsets that are proficient in intercultural competence, as well as (b) optimized, inclusive talent & people management systems. Success across both of these dimensions produces both a positive working experience and equitable outcomes for all.\r\n\r\nIn this session, we\u2019ll share strategies and characteristics of organizations that fall under one of three SCI Talent Systems stages: \u201cUnstructured/Defining\u201d, \u201cImplementing\u201d or \u201cOptimizing\u201d \u2013 around the following:\r\n\r\n  1.  Capability / Training Infrastructure\r\n  2.  Attracting & Recruiting Talent\r\n  3.  Interviewing & Hiring Talent\r\n  4.  Engaging & Retaining Talent\r\n  5.  Managing Performance & Career Advancement\r\n  6.  Pipeline Development & Talent Review\r\n  7.  Measurement & Accountability\r\n\r\nWe can\u2019t do everything, all at once, right now \u2013 but this session will provide you with a structure that you can utilize to prioritize and plan for your organization. We hope you can join us for this valuable session.\r\n\r\n\r\n<PERSON>\r\n(she/her)\r\nHead of Business Development\r\nXYZ",

It\u2019s a simple, \u201cExamining the Talent life cycle through a DEI lens\u201d 1-hr presentation. WSIA has no budget for us to facilitate (she was just contacting us as a courtesy to see if she could use our content), but she is offering us the oppty to facilitate in front of their members, as an oppty for us to get known and possibly gain new clients from it. \u00a0I think it\u2019s a great opportunity. Their members are insurance companies for businesses that need unusual coverage or very specific protections, or high-risk holdings. For example, insurance for celebrities, healthcare (e.g., body parts), guns, flood insurance, marine (boats), antiques, skydiving companies, construction companies and homebuilders (builders are frequently sued, so specialty insurance is necessary to negate the risk). This could be a chance for us to find clients in an underserved market. Here is the deck, I clumsily tried to put it in our new format \u2013 as a placeholder).",

It\u2019s a dynamic, action-oriented course that helps leaders close the gap between awareness and behavior when it comes to driving inclusion and equity in their organizations.  The session outlines three areas of development toward leading with conscious inclusion:\r\n\r\n  1.  starting with yourself and owning it,\r\n  2.  leading inclusive change around attracting talent, developing & advancing talent, and sustaining a culture of inclusion, and\r\n  3.  being accountable.\r\nParticipants are given an Action Plan template in advance, and as the workshop dives into each of the three areas, they take the time to document what are actions they will take to lead with conscious inclusion - at the individual, direct report, and organization level. Videos, case studies, and breakouts make this workshop practical and relevant, where each participant walks away with a concrete Action Plan.  The workshop also includes a set of 12 Behavior Boosts that would be sent to participants once a week immediately following the workshop, as reminders and reinforcers. All of our workshops are available in person or virtually.\r\n\r\nI also attach our Sustainable Culture of Inclusion\u2122 model and methodology for measuring organizational mindsets and systems, then using those insights to collaborate with senior leadership to co-create a DEI roadmap and actions plans.\r\n\r\nCULTURAL LITERACY RE: LGBTQ COMMUNITY\r\nIn terms of inclusion content focused on the <NRP> community, we do offer a cultural immersion about the LGBTQ+ community in the <LOCATION>, as well as 1- and 1.5-hour Spotlights.\r\n\r\nWould it be okay if we set up a short meeting to hear more about what you\u2019re thinking so we can devise best-fit recommendations? I\u2019d like to bring in Tamara into the conversation, if she\u2019s available, as she may be able to bring additional insights.\r\n\r\nWe\u2019re available on the following times for a 30-min meeting (ALL TIMES ET):\r\n\r\nTues Dec 12 noon-1pm\r\nDec 13 10-11am, 2-2:30pm\r\nDec 14 10-noon or 2-3pm\r\nDec 15 noon-3pm\r\n\r\nBest - Rebecca\r\n\r\n\r\n<PERSON>\r\n(she/her)\r\nHead of Client Solutions\r\nXYZ",

These past few years have truly been filled with change, directional shifts, and future uncertainty. We understand the importance of being a true partner and are excited to announce our exclusive initiative to support our stakeholders by conducting a comprehensive climate interview and survey. The goal of the survey will be to assess how the mindsets and systems within organizations have influenced organizational climate over the past few years and impacted inclusive workplaces. The information we collect from the interview and survey will be treated with utmost confidentiality and the key takeaways will be shared with all selected participants. Based on the key takeaways, we will be sharing relevant resources, developing new content, providing action steps, and offering opportunities to learn and collaborate with peers. \n\nPlease select the time that works best for a 30-minute interview: <URL>\n\nThank you for considering this opportunity.

Also sent a description of our \u201cLeading with Conscious Inclusion\u201d workshop and info on our SCI approach (see attached).12/8/23: I sent them a locked pdf of the LCI content, and described the prework for them, and also I expanded on the SCI discovery process.<PERSON> been trying to set up a meeting \u2013 at first it was scheduled for Jan 17 but they rescheduled.Leadership trainingOur new fiscal year starts April 1, 2024\u00b7 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 <PERSON> and below are done (training on this). \u00a0We want to hit the top \u2013 sponsorship \u2013 women of color, POC, women of other races, as a sponsor I have to build trust, the power of speaking about you when you\u2019re not in the room. How do you develop trust? I\u2019m going to put my social capital on them, will they listen to me.\u00b7 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 We\u2019re a <NRP> bank, don\u2019t have a lot of Black people here. We have one Black woman in <LOCATION>.\u00b7 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 AWB: What are you hoping to influence? What are you hoping to improve and influence, using sponsorship?\u00b7 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 <PERSON>: It\u2019s beyond sponsorship, it\u2019s ppl who make decisions that leave out people who are \u2018different\u2019. They tend to be white or <NRP> males. We have <NRP> leaders who are not <NRP> who are also overlooked. \u00a0Black and <NRP> talent too. Not that many. And how do we get these leaders to make different decisions when it comes to getting these folks in the door, hiring, through campuses. Judging people as \u2018not taking the initiative\u2019 \u2013 not realizing it\u2019s cultural. Not making assumptions about talent. They say, \u2018Managers don\u2019t have time to develop this talent\u2019\u00b7 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 <PERSON>: can\u2019t find the talent, don\u2019t have time to develop. That should never be an excuse. You need to coach, develop, and give feedback to talent.\u00b7 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 AWB: are there any structural markers that define success or DEI strategy?\u00b7 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 <PERSON>: help them find a way to develop their talent strategically, as they do to develop their business. Do your direct reports feel comfortable coming to you? Are you listening? Are they providing actionable feedback? Are they providing development opptys, key visible assignments? (RP note: \u2018Developing Talent Inclusively\u2019, tweak it to apply to any cultural group?) \u00a0\u00b7 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Our L&D dept offers cultural training, eg dimensions of culture\u00b7 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 <PERSON> talked about the IDI and how it\u2019s often used with senior leaders, also brought up BCI\u00b7 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 <LOCATION> \u2013 looking for a mindset change. They\u2019re using proxies \u2013 like Harvard, elite schools. What an SMBC employee \u2018should\u2019 look like. That perpetuates bias. Open conversations, building trust, intentional development opptys, setting people up for success, expanding what \u2018leader\u2019 is.\u00b7 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 RP: Start with outcomes \u2013 how will be measure success? Tie that to the initiative. Have each leader come up with a SMART goal for themselves (with your guidance). Action planning.\u00b7 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 AWB: what would you guys like us to do next?\u00b7 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 <PERSON> \u2013 send us more information on what we talked about today. We need to talk about the timeline.\u00b7 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 RP note: do you have data (engagement surveys, heading particular project or clients, data on variations in promotions or hiring, time it takes to promote).\u00b7 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 <PERSON>: Creating social value \u2013 empowerment, inequity, integrity\u2026.

I wanted to provide you with some updates to some questions you had asked.\r\n\r\nFirst, yes we are able to shorten the e-learnings  (e.g., split them in half), and we are also able to work on harmonizing the \"look and feel\". This would involve additional costs as you can imagine, and we're working on seeing what would be.\r\n\r\nRegarding the length of the e-learnings, I also wanted to remind you that the self-paced option allows the learner to pause at any point during the session, then re-enter at a later time exactly where they left off, which provides some nice flexibility depending on the learner\u2019s pace and bandwidth.\r\n\r\nWe\u2019ll get back to you soon with the additional costs of the above. If you have any other questions in the meantime, feel free to reach out!",

You can help your stakeholders make sense of it.\r\n\r\nHere are my thoughts. It seems to me the two main points that are being pushed back against are:\r\n\r\n  1.  Hiring or promotion \u2018quotas\u2019 (which is something that XYZ or any other DEI professional I know or have worked with has ever recommended) and\r\n  2.  \u2018Blaming\u2019 white populations by, for example, calling people \u2018white supremacists\u2019 or stating something ridiculous like all white people are racist.\r\n\r\nNeither of the points above are part of what achieving DEI is all about.

I\u2019m sorry I wasn\u2019t able to attend, I was in the midst of facilitating a session during that time. I\u2019m looking forward to meeting you soon.\r\nWe\u2019ve put together two proposal options based on our understanding of your needs:\r\nChoice Hotels seeks a partner to help upskill their leaders around driving a culture of inclusion in their teams and throughout the company. A culture of inclusion is one that engenders trust and mutual respect, where leaders actively listen and develop authentic relationships with their team members, and where employees aren't afraid to speak up and are comfortable bringing their full selves (and their ideas) to their roles at Choice Hotels - whether people are working onsite or virtually.\r\nBelow is a quick overview of the learning journey we envision for Choice Hotels' leaders:\r\n\r\n  *   Phase 1: Keynote delivery during December's Diversity Council gathering (with prework).\r\n  *   Phase 2:  \"Building a Culture of Inclusion for Leaders\" pilot (2-hr session, virtual, with prework).  Pilot attendees to be a diverse (function, tenure, age, gender, race/ethnicity, abilities, etc.) group of leaders, who can provide feedback on the session.\r\n  *   Phase 3, option 1: Train-the-Trainer for internal facilitators. Includes site license to program, facilitator notes, and PPT.\r\n  *   Phase 3, option 2: XYZ facilitates workshop for Choice Hotels leaders.We so appreciate your coming back to us after your prior experiences with XYZ, and are certainly grateful for the time you took to give us an overview of your Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion goals.\r\nFurther detail is included within the proposals. We send you two options:\r\nProposal #1 includes Phases 1 and 2 above, plus Phase 3, option 1 (Train-the-Trainer option)\r\nProposal #2 also includes Phases 1 and 2, and Phase 3, option 2 (XYZ facilitates workshops).\r\nCorinne, we look forward to meeting with you on Tuesday to walk you through these, and we are of course open to other options and can get creative if necessary. Our goal is to respond swiftly, make adjustments, and get you what you need to ensure alignment and move forward.\r\n\r\nHave a good weekend and we\u2019ll touch base next week.",

And we\u2019ll of course have some suggestions for them, as well as a takeaway. Throughout the workshop we\u2019ll use breakouts, polls, videos, and images to make points captivating and memorable.\r\n\r\nWe\u2019ve grouped some of the Behaviors that are similar in theme, to make the program move a bit faster:\r\n\r\n  *   (by itself and as the thing that acts as a foundation): Connects personal values with the organization\u2019s for meaning and purpose\r\n  *   Provides community and connection AND Leverages empathy and flexibility (two Behaviors grouped together)\r\n  *   Enables & provides team with opportunities for accomplishment, growth, and career mobility AND Offers recognition, appreciation, and positivity (two Behaviors grouped together)\r\n  *   Prioritizes psychological safety and well-being AND Facilitates a sense of belonging (two Behaviors grouped together)\r\nAnyway, the above is just some initial brainstorming we did \u2013 the final product would of course be well thought out from an instructional design and content standpoint.\r\n\r\nLooking forward to hearing from you in 2024.\r\n\r\nBest!\r\n<PERSON><PERSON>\r\n(she/her)\r\nHead of Client Solutions\r\nXYZ\r\nPlease note XYZ will be closed for winter break between December 25th through January 1st.",

I'm sorry I wasn't able to attend, I was in the midst of facilitating a session during that time. I'm looking forward to meeting you soon.\n>We've put together two proposal options based on our understanding of your needs:\n>Choice Hotels seeks a partner to help upskill their leaders around driving a culture of inclusion in their teams and throughout the company. A culture of inclusion is one that engenders trust and mutual respect, where leaders actively listen and develop authentic relationships with their team members, and where employees aren't afraid to speak up and are comfortable bringing their full selves (and their ideas) to their roles at Choice Hotels - whether people are working onsite or virtually.\n>Below is a quick overview of the learning journey we envision for Choice Hotels' leaders:\n>\n>  *   Phase 1: Keynote delivery during December's Diversity Council gathering (with prework).\n>  *   Phase 2:  \"Building a Culture of Inclusion for Leaders\" pilot (2-hr session, virtual, with prework).  Pilot attendees to be a diverse (function, tenure, age, gender, race/ethnicity, abilities, etc.) group of leaders, who can provide feedback on the session.\n>  *   Phase 3, option 1: Train-the-Trainer for internal facilitators. Includes site license to program, facilitator notes, and PPT.\n>  *   Phase 3, option 2: XYZ facilitates workshop for Choice Hotels leaders.We so appreciate your coming back to us after your prior experiences with XYZ, and are certainly grateful for the time you took to give us an overview of your Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion goals.\n>Further detail is included within the proposals. We send you two options:\n>Proposal #1 includes Phases 1 and 2 above, plus Phase 3, option 1 (Train-the-Trainer option)\n>Proposal #2 also includes Phases 1 and 2, and Phase 3, option 2 (XYZ facilitates workshops).\n>Corinne, we look forward to meeting with you on Tuesday to walk you through these, and we are of course open to other options and can get creative if necessary. Our goal is to respond swiftly, make adjustments, and get you what you need to ensure alignment and move forward.\n>\n>Have a good weekend and we'll touch base next week.\n>\n>All the best,\n><PERSON>\n>\n>\n>\n>\n><PERSON>\n>(she/her)\n>Head of Business Development\n>XYZ\n>[A picture containing font, graphics, logo, symbol  Description automatically generated]\n>\n>Website | Twitter | Facebook | LinkedIn\n>View our upcoming events | Sign-up for our newsletter\n>\n>I live and work in <LOCATION>, <LOCATION> - on the traditional homelands of the Occaneechi, Shakori, <PERSON>, and <LOCATION> peoples.\n>\n>\n>\n>\n>\n>\n>",

We all know that people exist who have these views but it's still a little shocking to hear them out loud, see them written out in documents and emails!\r\n\r\nMy perspective is we must continue to ensure that everyone understands and feels included by cultural competence and DEI efforts (which of course includes straight, white, nondisabled white men and women). And we must continue to firmly stand for equity and for taking steps to proactively understand each other's culturally influenced work styles, so that we can not only accept and learn from each other, but also use that insight to continue to innovate and cultivate inclusive high performance in ourselves and in our teams.\r\n\r\nExplore this gift article from The New York Times.

It seems to me the two main points that are being pushed back against are:\r\n\r\n  1.  Hiring or promotion 'quotas' (which is something that XYZ or any other DEI professional I know or have worked with has ever recommended) and\r\n  2.  'Blaming' white populations by, for example, calling people 'white supremacists' or stating something ridiculous like all white people are racist.\r\n\r\nNeither of the points above are part of what achieving DEI is all about. Inclusive practices are alive and well, and I think that most organizations understand that there's no going back.\r\n\r\n<URL>",

It is arguably the most scientifically rigorous and statistically validated tool for assessing and building intercultural competence,  the capability to shift cultural perspective and appropriately adapt behavior to cultural differences and commonalities. The assessment and research behind the IDI explores why some people are more effective navigating and bridging cultures than others. The tool is unique in how it quantifies the subjective \u2018experience\u2019 of cultural differences and provides a snapshot of the developmental process involved in building intercultural competence (a vital skill that feeds equity and inclusion) over time. The IDI helps people see that there are different ways of processing cultural differences and commonalities that are not based on our character or who we are as a person but on our experiences, our contexts, and what we\u2019ve been taught - and that there are things we can do to move further along the continuum.\r\n\r\nWe can certainly provide a 2-3 hour session on intercultural competence that connects with your objectives, in the context of your Emerging Leadership Programme.\r\n\r\nPlease let us know when would be a good day/time to meet.

My name is <PERSON>, and I\u2019m a longtime consultant, facilitator and content developer at XYZ.  <PERSON> is on my team.\r\n\r\nWe\u2019d love to meet with you to discuss further, but yes we do offer workshops on intercultural competence (the ability to navigate your own and other people\u2019s worldviews & interpretations to be more effective) for leaders.\r\n\r\nWe often use the Intercultural Development Inventory\u00ae to underpin skill development, especially with leaders.\r\n\r\nAbout the Intercultural Development Inventory\u00ae\r\nThe Intercultural Development Inventory\u00ae is a 50-item psychometric assessment. It is arguably the most scientifically rigorous and statistically validated tool for assessing and building intercultural competence,  the capability to shift cultural perspective and appropriately adapt behavior to cultural differences and commonalities. The assessment and research behind the IDI explores why some people are more effective navigating and bridging cultures than others. The tool is unique in how it quantifies the subjective \u2018experience\u2019 of cultural differences and provides a snapshot of the developmental process involved in building intercultural competence (a vital skill that feeds equity and inclusion) over time. The IDI helps people see that there are different ways of processing cultural differences and commonalities that are not based on our character or who we are as a person but on our experiences, our contexts, and what we\u2019ve been taught - and that there are things we can do to move further along the continuum.\r\n\r\nWe can certainly provide a 2-3 hour session on intercultural competence that connects with your objectives, in the context of your Emerging Leadership Programme.\r\n\r\nPlease let us know when would be a good day/time to meet. Both of us are located in <LOCATION> ET timezone.\r\n\r\nHope you have a wonderful holiday season!",

During my research, I came across your website, which I found impressive. I'd like to inquire if you provide solutions of this nature. Thank you, AlinaSuperbet the leading B2C online sports betting and gaming operator in <LOCATION>. Some of the categories provided by the platform include pre match and live sports betting, live casinos, lottery, slot games, table games, bingo, and more.

The person who received the feedback came back and said the feedback was all good and didn\u2019t \u2018get the message\u2019 about the critical feedback (<NRP> expect directness and <LOCATION> was too diplomatic \u2013 relative to one another).

Not sure leaders would be open to the IDI right now, maybe later.

It's an opportunity to engage in authentic, yearlong cultural literacy upskilling around the cultures that Uber staff belong to and are influenced and inspired by. With events being what they are in the world today, ensuring that we are all operating in a cross-culturally competent manner is even more critical.\r\n\r\nOur culture-specific Spotlights are not superficial.\r\n\r\nThese one-hour, interactive, deep-dive workshops are focused on the experience of being a member of these communities, and contribute to building cultural competence, inclusion skills, and a culture of belonging throughout the firm.\r\n\r\nSpotlight on:\r\nSuggested Delivery Month in 2024\r\nBlack/African American Community\r\nFebruary (Black History Month)\r\nWomen in Leadership\r\nMarch (Women's History Month)\r\n\r\nBeing an Ally for the Asian American Community\r\nMay (AAPI Heritage Month)\r\nThe LGBTQ+ Community\r\nJune (LGBTQ+ Pride Month)\r\nPersons with Disabilities\r\nJuly (Disability Pride Month)\r\nThe <NRP>/Latinx/e Community\r\nSeptember (Hispanic Heritage Month)\r\nIndigenous People in <LOCATION>\r\nOctober (Indigenous Peoples' Day) or November (Native American Heritage Month)\r\nU.S. Veterans Community\r\nNovember (Veterans' Day)\r\nU.S. Generations\r\nDecember (Or April or August)\r\n\r\nBoth people managers and individual contributors consistently find these sessions relevant and applicable for their workplace goals and relationships, as they include topics like:\r\n\r\n  *   Relevant statistics and data that communicate this community's makeup, impact, and experiences\r\n  *   The community's values, priorities, strengths\r\n  *   Dispelling any myths or stereotypes about the community\r\n  *   Challenges or barriers members of this group tend to face in the workplace, and\r\n  *   Strategies & tips for what participants can do to broaden inclusion and belonging for members of this community.\r\n\r\nNow through December, you can save 20% when you purchase our bundle of nine 1-hour, interactive, deep-dive workshops when you pay up front.\r\n\r\nI'm happy to schedule a time to discuss - if this fits into your plans at all.\r\n\r\n<PERSON>\r\n\r\n<PERSON> (He/Him)\r\nCo-CEO and Managing Principal\r\nXYZ\r\nOffice: <PHONE_NUMBER>\r\nMobile: <PHONE_NUMBER>\r\n\r\n[A picture containing font, graphics, logo, symbol  Description automatically generated]\r\n\r\nWebsite<",

We\u2019re currently scoping a new anti-bias training pilot for all interviewers and hiring managers at Uber. For the pilot, in addition to testing content, we want to experiment with 3 different modalities for delivery:1. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 live training,2. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 online/self-paced, and3. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 microlearning/just-in-time.We\u2019d like to offer these options to different test groups and gather data around which type of training is best attended, best-received by participants, and has the greatest impact on hiring behavior.We also would like to customize content across each region we operate within (EMEA, NAMER, APAC, and LATAM).The team has been in the process of meeting with vendors to learn about their offerings. Would it be possible to sync on a call next week? \u00a0CALL NOTES:Recently went through a civil rights assessment that requires hiring anti bias training (please see \u2018Equity in Hiring\u2019 section on pages 45-46 in their CRA Report.)Note: In the fall of 203, Uber took another step, and engaged Covington & Burling LLP (law firm) to assess the company\u2019s efforts to promote civil rights and DEI and to make recommendations for additional actions the company could take to achieve its civil rights and DEI objectives in <LOCATION>. \u00a0Covington reviewed documents and data; interviewed each member of the company\u2019s executive team and many internal subject-matter experts; convened roundtables with leaders of Uber\u2019s employee resource groups (ERGs) and members of Uber Crew (drivers and couriers elected to represent those communities); held a listening session with national advocacy and civil rights organizations; and spoke with nonprofit organizations with which Uber partners. \u00a0Based on this work, Covington concluded that Uber has taken significant steps to promote civil rights and DEI for all users on its <LOCATION> mobility platform, in its corporate workforce, and in the communities it serves. \u00a0Covington also identified additional steps the company could take to achieve these objectives\u2026Have an \u2018Advancing Anti Racism\u2019 trainingThe Anti Bias training should take about an hourUsed to have an online training called \u201cHire the Uber Way\u201d \u2013 but it isn\u2019t mandatory, just highly recommended - inclusion is a smallish part of this <URL><PERSON> built an <NRP> Jiring training \u2013 but it had to be delivered live, and right now don\u2019t have the scale and scope to deliver.<PERSON> \u2013 we could be doing more <PERSON> trainingOona King is new CDOPilot \u2013 iterating on content and modalityDiane: can you send <LOCATION> info on Performance management too: MBPR, link to ETIPopup or stopgap mechanism so that people can\u2019t interview others unless they complete the training.Testing in different regions \u2013 as a global pilot.

        "body": "Hi <PERSON>, <PERSON>, and <PERSON> (and I\u2019m sorry we didn\u2019t get to meet you on Friday, <PERSON>, looking forward to that in the future!),\r\n\r\nIt was great to meet you on Friday and thanks for walking us through your needs. We\u2019re working on a proposal for you but in the meantime I wanted to provide you with the links to the digital courses and microlearnings that we talked about so you can start reviewing them. Please ensure that only members of your decision making team review these.\r\n\r\nThe links will ask for your email addresses.\r\n\r\nANTI-BIAS LEARNING INTERVENTIONS: HIRING\r\n\r\neLearnings: Self-paced scalable programs which include narration, onscreen and downloadable content, quizzes, short writing activities, and other exercises that allow learners to pause, reflect and apply. Our eLearnings have been designed such that learners can\u2019t skip sections or leave the program running in the background. Each module requires active participation and full completion\r\n\r\n\r\n  *   \u201cHiring & Promoting Top Talent\u201d<<URL>>: This course explores the hidden bias in talent acquisition and development. It includes insights into how assessing for \u2018cultural fit\u2019 impacts the organization\u2019s ability to attract and hire culturally diverse top talent, and build and support a robust and diverse talent pipeline. Participants also explore how mentoring, staffing teams, key assignments, and coaching across cultures drive the readiness of top talent for their next opportunity.\r\n\r\n<PERSON>: Short, digital, impactful learning tools offer reinforcements for participants to access at the point of decision or needed action. Such \"in the moment\" nudges help sustain behavioral change, facilitating systemic transformation.\r\n\r\n\r\n  *   \u201cManaging Bias in Hiring<<URL>>\u201d: Unconscious biases can derail our best efforts to be objective and accurate when it comes to hiring the best person for the job. Is bias at play when we hire for \u2018cultural fit\u2019? Are we interpreting similarities with candidates as evidence that they will be successful in this role? Are groupthink or expectations about people of certain backgrounds limiting our ability to find the best candidates? This course allows us to become aware of our biases so that we can attend to them and interrupt them while evaluating and selecting diverse top talent.\r\n\r\n\r\n  *   \u201cManaging <PERSON> in Interviewing<<URL>>\u201d: Unconscious biases can derail our best efforts to interview candidates of all backgrounds objectively and accurately. Are we letting our commonalities with a candidate influence our perception of their skills or their \u2018fit\u2019? Are our perceptions of a candidate being unconsciously skewed based on preconceived judgments we formed from information on their r\u00e9sum\u00e9? Are we unconsciously changing the questions we ask to certain candidates? This course invites you to look for and mitigate unconscious bias that may be hampering your best intentions when interviewing diverse job candidates.\r\n\r\n\r\nANTI-BIAS LEARNING INTERVENTIONS: PERFORMANCE EVALUATION\r\n\r\n\r\n  *   eLearning: \u201cEvaluating Talent Inclusively<<URL>>\u201d: This program provides managers powerful examples of how bias can impact performance evaluation. Activities highlight meaningful examples of how to challenge bias in ourselves and one another and ensure that talent is evaluated objectively rather than by relying on mental models or shortcuts. Participants are given the opportunity to recognize and interrupt bias when evaluating performance, as well as when making promotion decisions based on that evaluation.\r\n\r\n\r\n  *   Microlearning: \u201cManaging Bias in Performance Reviews<<URL>>\u201d: Unconscious biases can derail our best efforts to be objective and accurate when it comes to evaluating performance. Are we inadvertently giving higher ratings to employees who are more \u2018like us\u2019? What are we doing to ensure our evaluation process is consistent across our entire team? Are we sure we\u2019re aware of the variety of work or projects each team member has worked on, or are we basing our evaluation only on those projects we know about? Are our expectations about a person skewing how we see them? Managing Unconscious Bias in Performance Reviews invites you to look for and mitigate biases in evaluating performance.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou\u2019ll hear back from us by the end of the week!",

Managing <PERSON> in Hiring:\r\n\r\n     *   You had a comment about this section of the video voiceover: \u201cHave you ever thought to yourself something like: \u201cHow will she handle all the travel the role requires?\u201d The real question is \u2013 do we also worry about such things for men? Such bias is based on stereotypes about gender roles. We need decision makers in the hiring process to challenge such bias, so it doesn\u2019t get in the way of us hiring top talent\u2014who in many cases will be women.\u201d\r\n     *   Your comment is \u201c<URL>ment made in voiceover that won\u2019t get in the way of hiring top talent in many cases with be women?? Sounds like fact. This piece needs to be rephrased.\u201d I\u2019d be interested in hearing more about is problematic here\u2026 Here the narration is giving an example about how we have double standards or judge people differently based on stereotypes about their gender. The part about \u201cwho in many cases will be women\u201d refers to that we will be inevitably be hiring women for some of our roles, as we don\u2019t look at gender as a factor when hiring and women make up roughly half the population.\r\n                       I feel this can be misconstrued by our audience as a goal. I would like to remove or change.  \"who in may cases will be women\"  Got it \u2013 so we\u2019ll remove the \u201cwho in many cases will be women\u201d part of the voiceover.\r\n\r\n\r\n  1.  Managing <PERSON> in Interviewing:\r\n\r\n     *   Re: the \u201cImplicit Stereotyping Bias\u201d in the \u201cTips for Mitigating Bias in Interviews\u201d section, one of the bullets says: \u201cSubstitute a different identity for the candidate, and test out if you\u2019d evaluate the person\u2019s behavior track record or skills the same way. For example, would you react negatively to a female candidate highlighting her competitiveness and toughness versus if a man did so? Or would you react differently to a Black candidate describing how hard working they are than to a white candidate saying the same thing?\u201d\r\n     *   Your comment is: \u201cI would change this example for other no ethnicity.\u201d I know you\u2019re referring to the question about race. Could you please say more about what you could like to see replace this question?\r\n                            I think this may  be <PERSON>'s comment? Yes, it was.\r\n\r\n\r\n  1.  Managing Bias in Talent Review:\r\n\r\n     *   In the video voiceover, one section says: \u201cFrom a talent review perspective, those in the majority are often blind to the experiences of those in the minority \u2013 who may have a higher bar or different performance expectations set for them, compared to their colleagues in the majority.\u201d The feedback from client is \u201cMajority versus the minority may be polarizing and alienate the majority if white males or is it any group that may be considered majority which can change based on the context Is there another way to rephrase? Also majority and minority may be more of <LOCATION> centric concept connected to diversity. Is there any way to reposition to be globally understood?\u201d Re: the \u201cmajority/minority\u201d phrasing \u2013 I do understand your comment, <PERSON>. And we were intentional about this language so that it resonates globally. Majority cultures differ by country/region \u2013 so for example in <LOCATION>, <NRP> are in the majority in terms of ethnicity. And in <LOCATION> most corporate leadership positions are filled by people who come from upper class socioeconomic backgrounds.  Thoughts? Let me look at the learning again. Based on the visual cues, it seemed more about men and women.  Will wait to hear from you on this one then. Another option could be to change the stock images/video rather than the voiceover narration \u2013 which would be more expensive.\r\n\r\n\r\n     *   Re: the Maya <PERSON> quote \u2013 I recommend that we replace with this quote: \u201cBeing 100% sure of yourself at all times betrays arrogance and breeds complacency. Questioning yourself reflects humility and propels growth.\u201d -- <PERSON>, Organizational Psychologist at the Wharton School and author of Hidden Potential: The Science of Achieving Greater Things   Thoughts? Are there other options?  Need a thought with simplicity in context. I did spend some time researching this morning and thought this one was the best of the ones I saw (plus it\u2019s a white man saying it, which also goes to your comment about diversifying the visuals of the microlearnings in general). If you have another suggestion we\u2019d be happy to insert it, or if you could provide more specificity around what you\u2019re looking for I could try again.\r\n\r\nEverything else was pretty clear.\r\n\r\nThanks, both!\r\n<PERSON><PERSON> (MBA, Latina, <NRP>, Mom)\r\n(she/her) Why pronouns matter<",

You had a comment about this section of the video voiceover: \u201c*Have\r\n>       you ever thought to yourself something like: \u201cHow will she handle all the\r\n>       travel the role requires?\u201d The real question is \u2013 do we also worry about\r\n>       such things for men? Such bias is based on stereotypes about gender roles.\r\n>       We need decision makers in the hiring process to challenge such bias, so it\r\n>       doesn\u2019t get in the way of us hiring top talent\u2014who in many cases will be\r\n>       women.\u201d*\r\n>       2. Your comment is \u201c<URL>ment made in voiceover that won\u2019t get in\r\n>       the way of hiring top talent in many cases with be women?? Sounds like\r\n>       fact. This piece needs to be rephrased.\u201d I\u2019d be interested in hearing more\r\n>       about is problematic here\u2026 Here the narration is giving an example about\r\n>       how we have double standards or judge people differently based on\r\n>       stereotypes about their gender. The part about \u201cwho in many cases will be\r\n>       women\u201d refers to that we will be inevitably be hiring women for some of our\r\n>       roles, as we don\u2019t look at gender as a factor when hiring and women make up\r\n>       roughly half the population.\r\n>\r\n>                        I feel this can be misconstrued by our audience as\r\n> a goal. I would like to remove or change.  \"who in may cases will be women\"\r\n> Got it \u2013 so we\u2019ll remove the \u201cwho in many cases will be women\u201d part of the\r\n> voiceover.\r\n>\r\n>\r\n>\r\n>    2. Managing <PERSON> in Interviewing:\r\n>\r\n>\r\n>    1. Re: the \u201cImplicit Stereotyping Bias\u201d in the \u201cTips for Mitigating\r\n>       Bias in Interviews\u201d section, one of the bullets says: \u201c*Substitute\r\n>       a different identity for the candidate, and test out if you\u2019d evaluate the\r\n>       person\u2019s behavior track record or skills the same way. For example, would\r\n>       you react negatively to a female candidate highlighting her competitiveness\r\n>       and toughness versus if a man did so? Or would you react differently to a\r\n>       Black candidate describing how hard working they are than to a white\r\n>       candidate saying the same thing?*\u201d\r\n>       2. Your comment is: \u201cI would change this example for other no\r\n>       ethnicity.\u201d I know you\u2019re referring to the question about race. Could you\r\n>       please say more about what you could like to see replace this question?\r\n>\r\n>\r\n>                             I think this may  be <PERSON>'s comment? Yes,\r\n> it was.\r\n>\r\n>\r\n>\r\n>    3. Managing <PERSON> in Talent Review:\r\n>\r\n>\r\n>    1. In the video voiceover, one section says: \u201c*From a talent review\r\n>       perspective, those in the majority are often blind to the experiences of\r\n>       those in the minority \u2013 who may have a higher bar or different performance\r\n>       expectations set for them, compared to their colleagues in the majority.*\u201d\r\n>       The feedback from client is \u201c*Majority versus the minority may be\r\n>       polarizing and alienate the majority if white males or is it any group that\r\n>       may be considered majority which can change based on the context Is there\r\n>       another way to rephrase? Also majority and minority may be more of <LOCATION>\r\n>       centric concept connected to diversity. Is there any way to reposition to\r\n>       be globally understood?*\u201d Re: the \u201cmajority/minority\u201d phrasing \u2013 I\r\n>       do understand your comment, <PERSON>. And we were intentional about this\r\n>       language so that it resonates globally. Majority cultures differ by\r\n>       country/region \u2013 so for example in <LOCATION>, <NRP> are in the majority\r\n>       in terms of ethnicity. And in <LOCATION> most corporate leadership positions\r\n>       are filled by people who come from upper class socioeconomic backgrounds.\r\n>       Thoughts? Let me look at the learning again. Based on the visual\r\n>       cues, it seemed more about men and women.  Will wait to hear from\r\n>       you on this one then. Another option could be to change the stock\r\n>       images/video rather than the voiceover narration \u2013 which would be more\r\n>       expensive.\r\n>\r\n>\r\n>\r\n>\r\n>    1.

It\u2019s pretty short, and gives language about the current challenges in corporate <LOCATION> (which are spreading to other parts of the world, unfortunately). You can help your stakeholders make sense of it.\r\n\r\nHere are my thoughts. It seems to me the two main points that are being pushed back against are:\r\n\r\n  1.  Hiring or promotion \u2018quotas\u2019 (which is something that XYZ or any other DEI professional I know or have worked with has ever recommended) and\r\n  2.  \u2018Blaming\u2019 white populations by, for example, calling people \u2018white supremacists\u2019 or stating something ridiculous like all white people are racist.\r\n\r\nNeither of the points above are part of what achieving DEI is all about. Inclusive practices are alive and well, and I think that most organizations understand that there\u2019s no going back.\r\n\r\n<URL><<URL>>",

This is key. During the program itself, facilitators and your stakeholder together, create a \u201cbrave\u201d space for all participants to feel heard and be engaged During the program, participants co-create a Team Charter: five to seven concrete behaviors that all team members will commit to going forward The workshop is facilitated by 2 highly skilled professionals who coach participants to arrive at solutions The workshop is designed for intact teams of up to 20 participants, conducive to deep attention to key issues that are getting in their way If this intervention sounds like something that would help remove an obstacle for your team (or another team in your org), we\u2019d love to hear more and see if/how we could help. \n\nSimply reply to this email and we can send a few available timeslots for you to choose from, or you could send us your availability if you prefer.",

You can, of course, decide not to go with the handbook at the end of the day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAlso, for your records, our Mini-Workshops/Spotlights start at $3,600 for a session, depending on facilitation model. We normally suggest that a session be limited to no more than 40 participants. Anything beyond that and the session becomes more lecture than training. Many clients will buy a couple of the session and hold them on different days/times to maximize attendance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease let us know if you have any questions.

Its been a while.\r\n\r\nPer our call, I am attaching information on BRG/ERG toolkit that we developed for a client who needed some added assistance in 'professionalizing' their approach to BRG/ERGs. They found that they didn't have a standard model, or even a standard set of expectations for their BRGs, as each had developed organically over the years. They also found that their Executive Sponsorship was inconsistent among the BRGs.\r\n\r\nWe led multiple conversations with represented populations to see what they know of BRGs at the organization, what they expected from their BRGs, and what was keeping them from joining (if they hadn't). We also spoke to the business leadership to understand their expectations. We then used this data to form the training and consulting interventions for both the BRG leaders and the executive sponsors.\r\n\r\nI will schedule some time next week to discuss any questions you might have.\r\n\r\n<PERSON>\r\n\r\n<PERSON> (He/Him)\r\nChief Executive Officer\r\nXYZ\r\nOffice: <PHONE_NUMBER>\r\nMobile: <PHONE_NUMBER>\r\n\r\n\r\n[A picture containing font, graphics, logo, symbol  Description automatically generated]\r\nWebsite<",

We understand the importance of being a true partner and are excited to announce our exclusive initiative to support our stakeholders by conducting a comprehensive climate interview and survey.

The information we collect from the interview and survey will be treated with utmost confidentiality and the key takeaways will be shared with all selected participants. Based on the key takeaways, we will be sharing relevant resources, developing new content, providing action steps, and offering opportunities to learn and collaborate with peers. \n\nPlease select the time that works best for a 30-minute interview: <URL>\n\nThank you for considering this opportunity.

        "body": "Hello Jakeim,\u200b \n\nI hope you're doing well. I wanted to follow up on my previous email regarding our Cross Cultural Learning Partner (CCLP) program, as I understand things can get busy. \n\nTo quickly recap, the CCLP program is an innovative and personalized DEI training designed to foster deeper cultural understanding and sustained growth. The Intercultural Development Inventory (IDI) Assessment is a crucial tool within the CCLP program, helping participants not only identify where they are in terms of intercultural competence but also guiding them through the phases of development. Here's how it elevates the training experience: \nUnderstanding Key Developmental Phases: Throughout the program, participants will navigate various phases of intercultural development, progressing from a primarily monocultural perspective to a more inclusive intercultural viewpoint. This understanding is essential for fostering inclusive environments and navigating cultural differences effectively. Targeted Growth: By taking the IDI assessment at the beginning of the program, participants establish a clear baseline of where they currently stand in their intercultural development journey. We follow up with post IDI assessments as well conducted at the end of the program. This allows us to clearly measure the progress they've made, highlighting the growth in their ability to navigate and understand cultural differences more effectively over the 6-12 month program. We\u2019d love to set up a time to discuss how the IDI assessment and the CCLP program can be implemented to meet your team\u2019s needs. Please let me know what week works best, and I can send over some times to connect. \n\nLooking forward to your response.",

Next week or the week after? (or whichever week works for you)\r\n\r\n\r\nAlso, I know that many workplaces have been talking about and affected by the <LOCATION>-Palestine conflict.

In case you or any of your colleagues is interested in a structure and process for having this dialogue, I attach the recently published Essential Guide to Dialogues about <LOCATION>-Palestine, put out by the organization Essential Partners<<URL>>.  The bulk of this guide/resource is about how to set up such a dialogue \u2013 including:\r\n\u00b7         The difference between dialogue and debate\r\n\u00b7         The importance of communication agreements (some really good ones included \u2013 pls see bottom of p. 6/top of p. 7)\r\n\u00b7         Logistics (how, where, what)\r\n\u00b7         Structures for reflection, speaking & listening (the Go-Round; the Intentional Pause; Reflect, Write, Respond)\r\n\u00b7         Preparing for the dialogue as a facilitator (lots of support provided!)\r\n\u00b7         Participant intervention tips (in-depth and valuable)\r\n\u00b7         A sample agenda\r\n\u00b7         Dialogue prompts (they offer a few sets of prompts, depending on what your audience and context is \u2013 please see the one on p. 20 which is designed for the purpose of \u2018better understanding different perspectives\u2019:\r\n\r\n\r\nThis dialogue guide is a great complement to our two brand new workshops: Spotlight on the Muslim Community in the <LOCATION> and Spotlight on the Jewish Community in the <LOCATION> These one-hour interactive, deep-dive workshops are focused on the experience of being a member of these communities, and aim at highlighting the their experiences, influences, values and rich cultures.\r\n\r\n\u262a\ufe0fSpotlight on the Muslim Community (1-hr)\r\nThis session explores the complexities of being <NRP> in <LOCATION> and the simultaneously varied and shared experiences and worldviews of <LOCATION>\u2019s <NRP> community.

We share best practices for supporting and providing allyship to our colleagues with the community, and how to counter antisemitic bias and microaggressions.\r\n\r\nPlease see attached one-pagers for each session, that you may share with your stakeholders.",

        "body": "Hi <PERSON>,\r\nHow are you?\r\n\r\nThanks so  much for taking the time to share your DEI goals with us last week. We\u2019d absolutely love to have an opportunity to work with y\u2019all!\r\n\r\nHere\u2019s a quick recap of what we heard you say:\r\n\u00b7         Energizer is an organization with a little over 5,000 colleagues around the world, about 50/50 salaried vs. hourly employees.\r\n\u00b7         DEIB foundation at Energizer is there, including a global DEIB Council and ERGs. You\u2019d like to take DEIB to the next level.\r\n\u00b7         Torrance helped you with an assessment and benchmarking \u2013 and now have a 6-year roadmap that includes various aspects of DEI, including TA, L&D, community outreach, etc.\r\n\u00b7         There is a Board of Directors meeting taking place this September, where you\u2019d like to present on your strategy and plans\r\n\u00b7         Energizer\u2019s LMS is connected to Linked In Learning, and you\u2019re now looking for some additional learning to complement it\r\n\u00b7         Each of the past 3 years has had a theme around DEI learning & development: first around Diversity, then Equity, and then inclusion. This year the focus is on Belonging, you already have two mandatory trainings for this year.\r\n\u00b7         This year Energize added a question about Belonging in its annual engagement survey. Your benchmark was 75 but Energizer scored a 77, which is fantastic. You\u2019ve looked at the employee comments in the survey, and a lot of them are around communication \u2013 in particular around working remotely (many people managers are managing employees in other countries) and understanding different cultures around the globe.\r\n\u00b7         You\u2019re interested in shorter, interactive bites of learning (e.g., 20-30 min).\r\n\u00b7         In speaking with XYZ, you\u2019re looking ahead to FY 2025 (which starts on Oct 1st, is that correct?)\r\n\r\nAttached is a short deck that contains:\r\n\r\n1.       Information and background on us (slides 1-9)\r\n\r\n2.       Overview of our eLearning courses (slides 10-12)\r\n\r\n3.       Overview of our microlearning courses (slides 13-14)\r\n\r\n4.       I also included info on our 1-hour interactive virtual facilitated mini-workshops, just in case! (slides 13-14)\r\n\r\nOne other thing I wanted to highlight, for your hourly employees who work in plants and distribution environments, are our Pre-Shift Discussion Guides for Plant Workers. These 'microlessons' are internally facilitated (by supervisors, managers, HR representatives) and designed to help facilitate conversations and engage in application with teams to strengthen learning outcomes and influence inclusive behaviors company-wide.\r\n\r\n1.       \"Identifying <PERSON>\" allows participants to identify unconscious bias from their own experiences. Participants will explore assumptions or judgments that either they have made or have been made about them, practice what to do when unconscious bias surfaces within the team, and identify behaviors to respectfully address out bias in the future.\r\n\r\n2.       \"Microinequities\" explores day-to-day examples and impacts of microinequities in participants\u2019 own workplace. Participants will learn more about microinequities and how they can affect an organization or team, hold an open discussion to identify examples of microinequities they\u2019ve seen, and identify behaviors (sometimes known as \u2018microaffirmations\u2019) that counter negative impacts of microinequities; for example, when we are intentional about finding ways to include team members and make sure they feel they belong.\r\n\r\n3.       \"Unstereotyping Through Relationship-Building\" explores the power of first impressions and implicit associations in evaluating colleagues\u2019 potential and value in our workplace. Participants will practice exploring the impact of visual cues that trigger unconscious biases and identify behaviors that can help counter unconscious biases, by stepping out of our comfort zone to develop relationships and more robust associations with people who are different from ourselves.\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease let me know if you\u2019d like to know more about any of the above, and we can send you more detailed info and pricing.",

        "body": "Dear Jakeim,\u200b\n\nI hope this message finds you well. At XYZ, we are always striving to innovate and provide the most impactful solutions for fostering Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion within organizations. With that commitment in mind, we are excited to introduce our updated and elevated training program: The Cross Cultural Learning Partner (CCLP).\n\nWhat makes our CCLP program stand out from traditional DEI training programs? It\u2019s designed to offer a more personalized, in-depth, and continuous learning experience. Here\u2019s how:\nCollaborative Learning: Unlike typical trainings where participants learn individually, CCLP pairs each participant with a learning partner that is culturally different in a significant way. This partnership encourages mutual support and shared growth, making the learning process richer and more effective. The cultural differences between partners offer real, lived scenarios that can be explored through open communication. Extended Engagement: While most DEI sessions are limited to just a few hours, our CCLP program spans 6 to 12 months. This extended timeframe allows for a deeper exploration of cultural competencies, continuous learning, and the opportunity to apply and reflect on insights over time. Real-World Scenarios: CCLP moves beyond hypothetical situations by integrating your unique experiences into the training. This makes the learning more relevant and directly applicable to the challenges and opportunities within your organization. Measurable Growth: Understanding your progress is key to effective learning. CCLP includes pre- and post-assessments, enabling participants to track their development and gain clear insights into how much they\u2019ve grown after the program. We believe that our CCLP program offers a transformative approach to DEI training, and we would love to explore how it can benefit your team or organization. If you\u2019re interested in learning more or setting up a time to discuss further, please don\u2019t hesitate to reach out.\n\nLooking forward to connecting!",

        "subject": "RE: Reconnect | XYZ & Tractor Supply",
        "body": "Hi <PERSON> \u2013 thanks for taking us through your DEI priorities.\r\n\r\nWe understand that you\u2019re currently refreshing TM and DEI strategy and roadmap, and that you, together with <PERSON>, TS\u2019 CHRO, broke out into 3 buckets what you\u2019re working to solve for:\r\n\r\n\r\n  1.  LEADERS \u2013 Directors and above, start with CEO and direct reports.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Challenge & Desired Approach\r\n\r\n  *   New people managers have a very robust 2-day leadership development program with an embedded internally-developed 1-hour DEI component. This component needs revamping, as currently it only touches on unconscious bias, microaggressions, and inclusive leadership but doesn\u2019t go deep enough, doesn\u2019t go into the nuances of actual people decisions, and it\u2019s more of a lecture vs. contextualized / interactive.\r\n  *   In addition, leaders are apprehensive about broaching these topics because they genuinely don\u2019t want to say the wrong thing. It\u2019s awkward and silence is preferable given the potential consequences for misspeaking, even it it\u2019s well-intentioned or based on sincere ignorance.\r\n  *   Unfortunately, this anxiety and silence has consequences with their teams, and it shows up for example in check-ins with their reports - who often do want to talk about this and who do have real concerns and important things to share that connect to their careers, engagement, and sense of belonging.\r\n  *   So the main challenge is, how can TS leaders connect and lead in a way that connects inclusively? How can leaders coach, develop, sponsor, and have conversations with team members in ways that makes team members of all backgrounds feel heard and understood? What can people managers do to be consciously inclusive and equitable when they assign stretch opportunities, important clients, and visible projects? When they evaluate team members for promotions and make succession planning decision? How can leaders be intentionally inclusive when it comes to recognition and rewards, engaging with TMEGs, and having the confidence and skills to acknowledge and talk about cultural differences vs. staying silent or pretending they don\u2019t exist?\r\n  *   The learning interventions should not center e.g., \u201cmicroaggressions\u201d and \u201cunconscious bias\u201d as \u2018bad things\u2019 that we need to get rid of. These topics will of course be broached, but in practical ways, in the context of realistic examples or scenarios. Rather than telling leaders and people managers what\u2019s important, show them. While they\u2019re considering a scenario, unpack the implications during the debrief and point out which behaviors may in fact be inadvertently introducing unfairness or exclusion.\r\n  *   The learning should get at the nuances of how unconscious bias, microinequities/microaggressions, and minimizing cultural differences gets in the way of being the inclusive, equitable leader you want to be.\r\n  *   The ultimate goal is to have leaders walk away being pleasantly surprised and armed with clear, practical tools to recognize when potential exclusion or inequity may be happening with themselves and others, and what they can do to intercept or correct it.\r\n\r\n\r\nXYZ\u2019s Approach for Tractor Supply Leaders\r\n\r\n  *   XYZ helps organizations deepen cultural understanding and foster inclusion and belonging by pushing the boundaries that shape our personal and professional communities. We partner with organizations globally to develop the mindsets, skills & systems to succeed in a culturally diverse world.\r\n  *   XYZ will create a learning experience that fits senior leaders and people managers based on the above. Our approach already aligns with Tractor Supply\u2019s. We recommend a mix of facilitated, interactive and dialogue-driven training, digital reinforcers, and resources they can refer to post-training that help them feel empowered to tackle conversations and take action on their own.\r\n  *   When we train virtually, we like to leverage certain tools that provide XYZ with the flexibility to be creative in how the training is structured and implemented.  We begin with our curriculum and proven approaches on <NRP> Leadership and we create an experience that is designed to be engaging and inclusive of different learning styles.  For example:\r\n     *   Visually group polling that engages participants in further discussions.\r\n     *   Quizzes and icebreakers that are interactive and visually engaging.\r\n     *   Audience participation tools to engage in what's under discussion and to ask questions.\r\n     *   Opportunities for participants to share ideas and impressions using word clouds and visual comments.\r\n  *   While these tools are not revolutionary, we leverage them to ensure confidentiality so participants are more comfortable weighing in on their opinions and impressions.  And engaging in learning frameworks such as case studies, videos, annotation, and small group discussions, participants are given opportunities to explore the topic in multiple ways with facilitation. Using the information collected in these tools, we can better track participant learning and insights.  For example, capturing comments on specific points in the framing of content helps XYZ know what is being learned and how to build on the current knowledge.\r\n  *   At the heart of our expertise is approaching DEI through a cultural competence-based lens. The foundation of our \u201cculture first\u201d approach to DEI learning is that we all belong to many different cultures- of nationality, race, generation, gender identity, abilities, religion, geographic region, educational background, socioeconomic background, and many more \u2013 at the same time. And each of those cultures are formed by particular experiences and influences in our lives, which have led us to certain core values and outward demonstrations of those values (behaviors) as being the \u2018best\u2019 and \u2018most effective\u2019. When we intentionally try to understand these experiences, influences, and values (in ourselves and others), we gain crucial insight into understanding, appreciating, navigating, and bridging behaviors that we may not initially be used to.\r\n\r\n\r\n  1.  HR PROFESSIONALS. HRBPs, HR VPs and Sr Directors, Talent Acquisition, Talent Learning and Development team (which includes DEI).\r\n\r\n  *   Members of these constituencies are not always sure how to anchor these conversations with senior leaders, people managers, and team members. These conversations are wide-ranging, and can include mediating particular behaviors that for some people might seem innocuous or simple but for others is offensive, hurtful, or disengaging. They need upskilling on DEI and intercultural competence, and how to use these insights to have productive conversations with the constituencies they serve.\r\n  *   Examples of facilitated workshops we can offer these cohorts are \u201cInclusive Talent Acquisition\u201d and  \u201cInclusive Talent Review,\u201d and we recommend the Intercultural Development Inventory for self-awareness and identifying areas of development as well.\r\n  *   We also have a \u201cFAQ about DEI\u201d document with answers that have been found useful by many HR leaders. We\u2019ve attached the list of questions to this email with a couple of sample answers.\r\n  *   I\u2019ve also attached our DEI Facilitator Development Guide as another sample tool that you\u2019re your HR leaders may find useful.\r\n  *   Learning interventions for these cohorts would be centered on helping them articulate, in plain terms, what is DEI is and why it\u2019s important, and on upskilling their intercultural competence and ability to have productive conversations about DEI.\r\n\r\n\r\n  1.  TEAM MEMBERS WHO ARE INDIVIDUAL CONTRIBUTORS. Tools/resources for team members in offices and in distribution centers and stores.\r\n\r\n  *   Here we would listen to your guidance but we have a library of digital eLearnings and microlernings:\r\n\r\neLearnings:\r\n\r\n     *   Introduction to Managing Unconscious Bias (IMUB) \u2013 For everyone\r\n     *   Culture & Identity (C&I) \u2013 For everyone\r\n     *   Practicing Inclusion (PI) \u2013 For everyone or for people managers\r\n     *   Fostering Collaboration (FC) \u2013 For people managers\r\n     *   Managing with Intercultural Competence (MIC) \u2013 For people managers\r\n     *   Hiring & Promoting Top Talent (HPTT) \u2013 For people managers\r\n     *   Evaluating Talent <PERSON> (<PERSON>) \u2013 For people managers\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJIT microLearnings: (for  people managers)\r\n\r\n     *   Managing <PERSON> in Recruiting (MBR)\r\n     *   Managing <PERSON> in Hiring (MBH)\r\n     *   Managing <PERSON> in Interviewing (MBI)\r\n     *   Managing Bias in Performance Reviews (MBPR)\r\n     *   Managing Bias in Talent Reviews (MBTR)\r\n  *   We\u2019re also able to provide tips and strategies for the screen in the break room, as you mentioned during our meeting, or as fillable pdfs for longer-term reference.\r\n  *   Finally, have Microlessons aka \u201cre-Shift Discussion Guides\u201d for team members who work in distribution or plant environments. These 'microlessons' are internally-facilitated conversations and engage in application with teams to strengthen learning outcomes and influence inclusive behaviors company-wide. Topics include \u201cIdentifying <PERSON>\u201d, \u201cMicroinequities\u201d, and \u201cUnstereotyping Through Relationship Building\u201d.\r\n\r\n\r\nFinally \u2013 the attached deck is broken out into:\r\n\r\n  *   Slides 1-4: About XYZ\r\n  *   Slides 5-27 Examples of our frameworks and approaches, with some sample content.\r\n\r\nI\u2019ve also been meaning to say kudos to <PERSON> for being on the CEO Action for D&I!\r\n\r\nPlease let us know if you need us to clarify anything, and we\u2019ll follow up with you in the next week.\r\n\r\nWarmly,\r\n<PERSON><PERSON><",

Where we surprise them about their assumptions coming <URL>xt steps \u2013Send them info that demonstrates our approach (DIN model, our culture-based approach.

The budget reason is pretty clear, but we'd love to further understand where our customization abilities (or other areas) fell short, as compared to the other vendor. Is it possible to have a quick 10-15  min call about this? Or, email is fine too if that's easier for you!

I hope you\u2019re doing well.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe\u2019d love to continue our conversation about supporting your the equity learning program.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nObviously there\u2019s a lot of discourse about DEI right now and much of it is unhelpful to people charged with solving complex people dynamics in the workplace. We\u2019re emphasizing ensuring people understand what we mean by inclusion and equity (countering some of the media narrative re: \u2018DEI\u2019 being about discrimination) and that inclusion means everyone, continuing to find ways to collect useful and compelling data that shows inconsistent experiences within the org (in particular around development/career advancement opportunities, pay, promotion rates, and psychological safety), and designing/embedding inclusive practices into the org\u2019s day-to-day operations rather than it being perceived as a separate thing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis new HBR article by <PERSON><<URL>> talks about the current landscape as an opportunity to reimagine or \u2018reset\u2019 DEI. Lily presents the FAIR acronym, which is substantially similar to DEI. However, I want to highlight <PERSON>\u2019s intriguing reframing  of the \u2018R\u2019 which stands for representation. Framing representation as a matter of transparency, trust, and a track record of accountability. Here\u2019s an excerpt:\r\n\r\nIf a product team aims to build products \u201cfor all people\u201d but does not consult or include perspectives from a key audience in their design process, that audience lacks representation \u2014 even if a member of the product team shares an identity with that audience\u2026. Representation is a matter of trust, not tokenism. While people may be slightly more inclined to trust those who share identities in common with them, trust is more dependent on the behavior and track record of those in power. It\u2019s possible for a leadership team made up entirely of women to be non-representative of women if none of the leaders take the effort to understand and advocate for the needs of the women they supposedly represent. On the other hand, it\u2019s possible that a product team without direct experience living in rural communities might be very representative of rural communities due to frequent communication, active outreach, and ongoing efforts to understand and advocate for rural communities\u2019 needs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat are TD Bank\u2019s inclusion goals for 2025? I\u2019d love to hear about them\u2026 including what kind of support you\u2019re getting from leadership.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWould you be open to a brief call next week or the next?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLooking forward to reconnecting!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCopying my colleague <PERSON> \u2013 as my bandwidth has been tricky lately, I want to make sure one of us replies as quickly as possible.",

Their statements (except perhaps Tractor Supply\u2019s) seem to want it both ways, saying that inclusion and diversity are still incredibly important, and at the same time making extreme <LOCATION> conservative activists happy by retrenching on things like <NRP> inclusion (specifically removing themselves from the HRC Equality Index and/or promising not to participate in any more Pride parades). It\u2019s extremely disheartening that they\u2019re all copying each other on this \u2013 I can see how targeting the LGBTQ+ community is the \u2018easiest\u2019 target, we\u2019re such a minority, the object of so much far-right rage, and historically \u2018safe enough\u2019 to ignore. I have also seen companies dissolve their DEI teams, instead merging the practice into OD, Learning &  Development, or other areas under HR. So sad.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the flip side, congratulations on being ranked #9 on Forbes list of <LOCATION>\u2019s Best Employers for Diversity 2024 for the 6th consecutive year and #20 on Fair360's list of 2024 Top 50 Companies for the 12th year in a row!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI know a while ago we talked about strategies to upskill TD Bank\u2019s leaders around equity and belonging.

I hope you\u2019re doing well.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe\u2019d love to continue our conversation about supporting your the equity learning program.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nObviously there\u2019s a lot of discourse about DEI right now and much of it is unhelpful to people charged with solving complex people dynamics in the workplace. We\u2019re emphasizing ensuring people understand what we mean by inclusion and equity (countering some of the media narrative re: \u2018DEI\u2019 being about discrimination) and that inclusion means everyone, continuing to find ways to collect useful and compelling data that shows inconsistent experiences within the org (in particular around development/career advancement opportunities, pay, promotion rates, and psychological safety), and designing/embedding inclusive practices into the org\u2019s day-to-day operations rather than it being perceived as a separate thing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis new HBR article by <PERSON><URL>> talks about the current landscape as an opportunity to reimagine or \u2018reset\u2019 DEI. Lily presents the FAIR acronym, which is substantially similar to DEI. However, I want to highlight <PERSON>\u2019s intriguing reframing  of the \u2018R\u2019 which stands for representation. Framing representation as a matter of transparency, trust, and a track record of accountability. Here\u2019s an excerpt:\r\n\r\nIf a product team aims to build products \u201cfor all people\u201d but does not consult or include perspectives from a key audience in their design process, that audience lacks representation \u2014 even if a member of the product team shares an identity with that audience\u2026. Representation is a matter of trust, not tokenism. While people may be slightly more inclined to trust those who share identities in common with them, trust is more dependent on the behavior and track record of those in power. It\u2019s possible for a leadership team made up entirely of women to be non-representative of women if none of the leaders take the effort to understand and advocate for the needs of the women they supposedly represent. On the other hand, it\u2019s possible that a product team without direct experience living in rural communities might be very representative of rural communities due to frequent communication, active outreach, and ongoing efforts to understand and advocate for rural communities\u2019 needs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat are TD Bank\u2019s inclusion goals for 2025? I\u2019d love to hear about them\u2026 including what kind of support you\u2019re getting from leadership.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWould you be open to a brief call next week or the next?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLooking forward to reconnecting!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCopying my colleague <PERSON> \u2013 as my bandwidth has been tricky lately, I want to make sure one of us replies as quickly as possible.",

        "body": "Hi <PERSON>, how are you, especially considering the DEI pullback lately by companies like Harley Davidson, Ford, Lowe's, <PERSON>, Jack Daniel's and Tractor Supply?  Their statements (except perhaps Tractor Supply's) seem to want it both ways, saying that inclusion and diversity are still incredibly important, and at the same time making extreme <LOCATION> conservative activists happy by retrenching on things like <NRP> inclusion (specifically removing themselves from the HRC Equality Index and/or promising not to participate in any more Pride parades). It's extremely disheartening that they're all copying each other on this - I can see how targeting the LGBTQ+ community is the 'easiest' target, we're such a minority, the object of so much far-right rage, and historically 'safe enough' to ignore. I have also seen companies dissolve their DEI teams, instead merging the practice into OD, Learning &  Development, or other areas under HR. So sad.\r\n\r\nOn the flip side, congratulations on being ranked #9 on Forbes list of <LOCATION>'s Best Employers for Diversity 2024 for the 6th consecutive year and #20 on Fair360's list of 2024 Top 50 Companies for the 12th year in a row!\r\n\r\nI know a while ago we talked about strategies to upskill TD Bank's leaders around equity and belonging. Should we continue those discussions, or did you move in a different direction? Either way, I'd love to know, and also stay in touch and hopefully at some point there will be an opportunity for us to help operationalize your DEI strategy.\r\n\r\nI'd be glad to set up a quick meeting (15 or 30 min) to connect!",

It\u2019s pretty short, and gives language about the current challenges in corporate <LOCATION> (which are spreading to other parts of the world, unfortunately). You can help your stakeholders make sense of it.\r\n\r\nHere are my thoughts. It seems to me the two main points that are being pushed back against are:\r\n\r\n  1.  Hiring or promotion \u2018quotas\u2019 (which is something that XYZ or any other DEI professional I know or have worked with has ever recommended) and\r\n  2.  \u2018Blaming\u2019 white populations by, for example, calling people \u2018white supremacists\u2019 or stating something ridiculous like all white people are racist.\r\n\r\nNeither of the points above are part of what achieving DEI is all about. Inclusive practices are alive and well, and I think that most organizations understand that there\u2019s no going back.\r\n\r\n<URL><<URL>>",

This is key. During the program itself, facilitators and your stakeholder together, create a \u201cbrave\u201d space for all participants to feel heard and be engaged During the program, participants co-create a Team Charter: five to seven concrete behaviors that all team members will commit to going forward The workshop is facilitated by 2 highly skilled professionals who coach participants to arrive at solutions The workshop is designed for intact teams of up to 20 participants, conducive to deep attention to key issues that are getting in their way If this intervention sounds like something that would help remove an obstacle for your team (or another team in your org), we\u2019d love to hear more and see if/how we could help. \n\nSimply reply to this email and we can send a few available timeslots for you to choose from, or you could send us your availability if you prefer.",

ALWAYS VERIFY THE SOURCE OF MESSAGES.\r\n\r\nHi, Envestnet team \u2013\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAttached please find a revised proposal, which includes onsite, in person sessions vs. virtual.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAs I thought through the one-facilitator model for these sessions, I realized I was too quick in my response during our meeting last week. I wasn\u2019t thinking about how large these groups were (75-100), plus to get the full learning across these culture-specific, longer workshops we do require one cultural insider (a member of the culture being taught about) and an ally (non-culture member) to deliver and model the concepts and strategies in the content. In this case, for \u201cWorking with the USA\u201d, a <LOCATION> American DEI expert would be the cultural insider and the ally would ideally be an <NRP> cofacilitator (we\u2019d scan our global network to find someone in <LOCATION>). An <NRP> DEI expert would be the cultural insider for \u201cWorking with India\u201d and the ally would be an <NRP>.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe can develop a shorter post-workshop sessions specifically for people managers, as we talked about last week. We can discuss what that would look like, and add those to this SOW or create a separate SOW in the future \u2013 whichever option works best for you. There would be a development cost and a facilitation cost for such a session. For a one hour session, for example, the cost ballpark would be about $4-$5k for development (assuming about two days of work) and then about $4500k for virtual facilitation and $10k for onsite facilitation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFinally, is there anything that we haven\u2019t asked you or talked about that  you need from this initiative?",

We\u2019ll follow up with those under separate cover if that\u2019s okay. We wanted to send you the main proposal as quickly as possible!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<PERSON>, if the attached is only almost right for your needs, then we look forward to hearing from you so that we can respond swiftly, make adjustments, and get you what you need to ensure alignment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe look forward to working with you!",

The budget reason is pretty clear, but we'd love to further understand where our customization abilities (or other areas) fell short, as compared to the other vendor. Is it possible to have a quick 10-15  min call about this? Or, email is fine too if that's easier for you!

        "body": "Hi, Envestnet team -\r\n\r\nAttached please find a revised proposal, which includes onsite, in person sessions vs. virtual.\r\n\r\nAs I thought through the one-facilitator model for these sessions, I realized I was too quick in my response during our meeting last week. I wasn't thinking about how large these groups were (75-100), plus to get the full learning across these culture-specific, longer workshops we do require one cultural insider (a member of the culture being taught about) and an ally (non-culture member) to deliver and model the concepts and strategies in the content. In this case, for \"Working with the USA\", a <LOCATION> American DEI expert would be the cultural insider and the ally would ideally be an <NRP> cofacilitator (we'd scan our global network to find someone in <LOCATION>). An <NRP> DEI expert would be the cultural insider for \"Working with India\" and the ally would be an <NRP>.\r\n\r\nWe can develop a shorter post-workshop sessions specifically for people managers, as we talked about last week. We can discuss what that would look like, and add those to this SOW or create a separate SOW in the future - whichever option works best for you. There would be a development cost and a facilitation cost for such a session. For a one hour session, for example, the cost ballpark would be about $4-$5k for development (assuming about two days of work) and then about $4500k for virtual facilitation and $10k for onsite facilitation.\r\n\r\nFinally, is there anything that we haven't asked you or talked about that  you need from this initiative?",

Wanted to let you know that <PERSON> is leaving XYZ at the end of January and I will be serving as <PERSON> consultant at XYZ going forward. I was already working with you and supporting <PERSON>, so I was happy to hear that your account was 'officially' transitioned to me.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnyway, there's a lot of discourse about DEI right now and much of it is unhelpful to people charged with solving complex people dynamics in the workplace.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOn our end, I'm emphasizing ensuring people understand what we mean by inclusion and equity (countering some of the media narrative re: 'DEI' being about discrimination) and that inclusion means everyone, continuing to find ways to collect useful and compelling data that shows inconsistent experiences within the org (in particular around development/career advancement opportunities, pay, promotion rates, and psychological safety), and designing/embedding inclusive practices into the org's day-to-day operations rather than it being perceived as a separate thing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis brand new HBR article by <PERSON><<URL>> talks about the current landscape as an opportunity to reimagine or 'reset' DEI. Lily presents the FAIR acronym, which is substantially similar to DEI. However, I want to highlight <PERSON>'s intriguing reframing  of the 'R' which stands for representation. Framing representation as a matter of transparency, trust, and a track record of accountability. Here's an excerpt:\r\n\r\nIf a product team aims to build products \"for all people\" but does not consult or include perspectives from a key audience in their design process, that audience lacks representation - even if a member of the product team shares an identity with that audience.... Representation is a matter of trust, not tokenism. While people may be slightly more inclined to trust those who share identities in common with them, trust is more dependent on the behavior and track record of those in power. It's possible for a leadership team made up entirely of women to be non-representative of women if none of the leaders take the effort to understand and advocate for the needs of the women they supposedly represent. On the other hand, it's possible that a product team without direct experience living in rural communities might be very representative of rural communities due to frequent communication, active outreach, and ongoing efforts to understand and advocate for rural communities' needs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat are <PERSON> inclusion goals for 2025? I'd love to hear about them, including what kind of support you're getting from leadership.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWould you be open to a brief call next week or the next?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLooking forward to reconnecting!",

I was already working with you and supporting <PERSON>, so I was happy to hear that your account was \u2018officially\u2019 transitioned to me.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnyway, there\u2019s a lot of discourse about DEI right now and much of it is unhelpful to people charged with solving complex people dynamics in the workplace.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOn our end, I\u2019m emphasizing ensuring people understand what we mean by inclusion and equity (countering some of the media narrative re: \u2018DEI\u2019 being about discrimination) and that inclusion means everyone, continuing to find ways to collect useful and compelling data that shows inconsistent experiences within the org (in particular around development/career advancement opportunities, pay, promotion rates, and psychological safety), and designing/embedding inclusive practices into the org\u2019s day-to-day operations rather than it being perceived as a separate thing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis brand new HBR article by <PERSON><<URL>> talks about the current landscape as an opportunity to reimagine or \u2018reset\u2019 DEI. Lily presents the FAIR acronym, which is substantially similar to DEI. However, I want to highlight <PERSON>\u2019s intriguing reframing  of the \u2018R\u2019 which stands for representation. Framing representation as a matter of transparency, trust, and a track record of accountability. Here\u2019s an excerpt:\r\n\r\nIf a product team aims to build products \u201cfor all people\u201d but does not consult or include perspectives from a key audience in their design process, that audience lacks representation \u2014 even if a member of the product team shares an identity with that audience\u2026. Representation is a matter of trust, not tokenism. While people may be slightly more inclined to trust those who share identities in common with them, trust is more dependent on the behavior and track record of those in power. It\u2019s possible for a leadership team made up entirely of women to be non-representative of women if none of the leaders take the effort to understand and advocate for the needs of the women they supposedly represent. On the other hand, it\u2019s possible that a product team without direct experience living in rural communities might be very representative of rural communities due to frequent communication, active outreach, and ongoing efforts to understand and advocate for rural communities\u2019 needs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat are <PERSON> inclusion goals for 2025?

These past few years have truly been filled with change, directional shifts, and future uncertainty. We understand the importance of being a true partner and are excited to announce our exclusive initiative to support our stakeholders by conducting a comprehensive climate interview and survey. The goal of the survey will be to assess how the mindsets and systems within organizations have influenced organizational climate over the past few years and impacted inclusive workplaces. The information we collect from the interview and survey will be treated with utmost confidentiality and the key takeaways will be shared with all selected participants. Based on the key takeaways, we will be sharing relevant resources, developing new content, providing action steps, and offering opportunities to learn and collaborate with peers. \n\nPlease select the time that works best for a 30-minute interview: <URL>\n\nThank you for considering this opportunity.

Can we connect to discuss and get an updated proposal?\u201cThe proposal <PERSON> is referring to is probably this <URL>LL NOTES:\u00b7 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Budget was finally approved \u2013 it took three months to approve this year\u2019s budget!\u00b7 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Annual DEI Report has historically been done in-house, their marketing dept. It took a lot of resources.\u00b7 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 <PERSON> (their C Talent Officer) suggested contacting us to see how we can help. They put $ in the budget to improve our DEI Report and outsource it.\u00b7 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Looking at expanding it from annual. We\u2019re really doing it every 18 mos but focus on the prior year. For example the one that\u2019s up there now says 2023 but it\u2019s actually from our 2022 activity.\u00b7 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 We need DEI lens to help us bring forth the stories and info that should be in a DEI report. The marketing dept has been doing the same thing every year, but want to take another look.\u00b7 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 We want to ensure we\u2019re highlighting some of our people, you would help us interview specific folks to get their quotes in the report. We also want to highlight people - their connection to our firm and how they fit into the bigger picture of DEI in the org.\u00b7 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 New report should be more engaging, interactive, graphics, maybe more white space, less text.\u00b7 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 We\u2019d want you to create the whole thing, lay it out, and graphic design it.\u00b7 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 We want to highlight outcomes, outside of representation (already had a bad experience with this in the past). We want to highlight our internal processes.\u00b7 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 My role has had a lot of turnover \u2013 a lot of what was done in the past was in response to what happened in 2020. Trying to \u2018fix\u2019 the disparity (in representation) instead of focusing on inclusion and equity (which then in turn will naturally increase diversity). We need to focus on how we\u2019re keeping people at TH \u2013 focus on retaining the people who are already here. Doesn\u2019t mean that we can\u2019t make our recruiting process more inclusive, for example. We\u2019ve done great around diverse slates \u2013 Mansfield Rule certified.\u00b7 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Women and POC still have a higher attrition rate.\u00b7 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Now <PERSON> has a better handle on TH data, more organized. Not sure we want not do full page interviews anymore. Make it more interactive, pull quotes and graphics.\u00b7 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Want to talk more about what we\u2019re actually doing.\u00b7 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 What are the ways we\u2019re doing to be inclusive \u2013 DEI Summit, other programs, initiatives, and what the outcomes are starting to look like.\u00b7 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Highlight excellence at Thompson Hine of POC, women, PwD, LGBTQ+, etc. \u00a0\u00b7 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 This is confidential info so don\u2019t share, but as of May 1st we\u2019ll have a new Managing Partner, <PERSON>, who is Black. He\u2019s been in exec committee and has had many leadership positions at TH. The outgoing Managing Partner is <PERSON>. In our current DEI Report we have an interview between <PERSON> and <PERSON> \u2013 it would be great to have a similar interview in the new DEI report, but \u00a0between <PERSON> and <PERSON> \u2013 <PERSON> interviewing <PERSON> for example. \u00a0\u00b7 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 This will be a client facing document, up on our web site.

We share best practices for supporting and providing allyship to our colleagues with the community, and how to counter antisemitic bias and microaggressions.\r\n\r\nIf you\u2019re interested in talking further about scheduling these vital learning opportunities, please reply to this email and we can set up a meeting.",

Wanted to let you know that <PERSON> is leaving XYZ at the end of January and I will be serving as <PERSON> consultant at XYZ going forward. I was already working with you and supporting <PERSON>, so I was happy to hear that your account was \u2018officially\u2019 transitioned to me.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnyway, there\u2019s a lot of discourse about DEI right now and much of it is unhelpful to people charged with solving complex people dynamics in the workplace.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOn our end, I\u2019m emphasizing ensuring people understand what we mean by inclusion and equity (countering some of the media narrative re: \u2018DEI\u2019 being about discrimination) and that inclusion means everyone, continuing to find ways to collect useful and compelling data that shows inconsistent experiences within the org (in particular around development/career advancement opportunities, pay, promotion rates, and psychological safety), and designing/embedding inclusive practices into the org\u2019s day-to-day operations rather than it being perceived as a separate thing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis brand new HBR article by <PERSON><<URL>> talks about the current landscape as an opportunity to reimagine or \u2018reset\u2019 DEI. Lily presents the FAIR acronym, which is substantially similar to DEI. However, I want to highlight <PERSON>\u2019s intriguing reframing  of the \u2018R\u2019 which stands for representation. Framing representation as a matter of transparency, trust, and a track record of accountability. Here\u2019s an excerpt:\r\n\r\nIf a product team aims to build products \u201cfor all people\u201d but does not consult or include perspectives from a key audience in their design process, that audience lacks representation \u2014 even if a member of the product team shares an identity with that audience\u2026. Representation is a matter of trust, not tokenism. While people may be slightly more inclined to trust those who share identities in common with them, trust is more dependent on the behavior and track record of those in power. It\u2019s possible for a leadership team made up entirely of women to be non-representative of women if none of the leaders take the effort to understand and advocate for the needs of the women they supposedly represent. On the other hand, it\u2019s possible that a product team without direct experience living in rural communities might be very representative of rural communities due to frequent communication, active outreach, and ongoing efforts to understand and advocate for rural communities\u2019 needs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat are <PERSON> inclusion goals for 2025? I\u2019d love to hear about them, including what kind of support you\u2019re getting from leadership.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWould you be open to a brief call next week or the next?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLooking forward to reconnecting!",

Wanted to let you know that <PERSON> is leaving XYZ at the end of January and I will be serving as <PERSON> consultant at XYZ going forward. I was already working with you and supporting <PERSON>, so I was happy to hear that your account was \u2018officially\u2019 transitioned to me.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnyway, there\u2019s a lot of discourse about DEI right now and much of it is unhelpful to people charged with solving complex people dynamics in the workplace.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOn our end, I\u2019m emphasizing ensuring people understand what we mean by inclusion and equity (countering some of the media narrative re: \u2018DEI\u2019 being about discrimination) and that inclusion means everyone, continuing to find ways to collect useful and compelling data that shows inconsistent experiences within the org (in particular around development/career advancement opportunities, pay, promotion rates, and psychological safety), and designing/embedding inclusive practices into the org\u2019s day-to-day operations rather than it being perceived as a separate thing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis brand new HBR article by <PERSON><<URL>> talks about the current landscape as an opportunity to reimagine or \u2018reset\u2019 DEI. Lily presents the FAIR acronym, which is substantially similar to DEI. However, I want to highlight <PERSON>\u2019s intriguing reframing  of the \u2018R\u2019 which stands for representation. Framing representation as a matter of transparency, trust, and a track record of accountability. Here\u2019s an excerpt:\r\n\r\nIf a product team aims to build products \u201cfor all people\u201d but does not consult or include perspectives from a key audience in their design process, that audience lacks representation \u2014 even if a member of the product team shares an identity with that audience\u2026. Representation is a matter of trust, not tokenism. While people may be slightly more inclined to trust those who share identities in common with them, trust is more dependent on the behavior and track record of those in power. It\u2019s possible for a leadership team made up entirely of women to be non-representative of women if none of the leaders take the effort to understand and advocate for the needs of the women they supposedly represent. On the other hand, it\u2019s possible that a product team without direct experience living in rural communities might be very representative of rural communities due to frequent communication, active outreach, and ongoing efforts to understand and advocate for rural communities\u2019 needs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat are <PERSON> inclusion goals for 2025? I\u2019d love to hear about them, including what kind of support you\u2019re getting from leadership.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWould you be open to a brief call next week or the next?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLooking forward to reconnecting!",

Understand how many organizations have historically exploited the holiday. Explore ways in which individuals and organizations can commit to supporting and advocating for <NRP> communities beyond designated months or holidays.

Wanted to let you know that <PERSON> is leaving XYZ at the end of January and I will be serving as <PERSON> consultant at XYZ going forward. I was already working with you and supporting <PERSON>, so I was happy to hear that your account was 'officially' transitioned to me.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnyway, there's a lot of discourse about DEI right now and much of it is unhelpful to people charged with solving complex people dynamics in the workplace.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOn our end, I'm emphasizing ensuring people understand what we mean by inclusion and equity (countering some of the media narrative re: 'DEI' being about discrimination) and that inclusion means everyone, continuing to find ways to collect useful and compelling data that shows inconsistent experiences within the org (in particular around development/career advancement opportunities, pay, promotion rates, and psychological safety), and designing/embedding inclusive practices into the org's day-to-day operations rather than it being perceived as a separate thing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis brand new HBR article by <PERSON><<URL>> talks about the current landscape as an opportunity to reimagine or 'reset' DEI. Lily presents the FAIR acronym, which is substantially similar to DEI. However, I want to highlight <PERSON>'s intriguing reframing  of the 'R' which stands for representation. Framing representation as a matter of transparency, trust, and a track record of accountability. Here's an excerpt:\r\n\r\nIf a product team aims to build products \"for all people\" but does not consult or include perspectives from a key audience in their design process, that audience lacks representation - even if a member of the product team shares an identity with that audience.... Representation is a matter of trust, not tokenism. While people may be slightly more inclined to trust those who share identities in common with them, trust is more dependent on the behavior and track record of those in power. It's possible for a leadership team made up entirely of women to be non-representative of women if none of the leaders take the effort to understand and advocate for the needs of the women they supposedly represent. On the other hand, it's possible that a product team without direct experience living in rural communities might be very representative of rural communities due to frequent communication, active outreach, and ongoing efforts to understand and advocate for rural communities' needs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat are <PERSON> inclusion goals for 2025? I'd love to hear about them, including what kind of support you're getting from leadership.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWould you be open to a brief call next week or the next?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLooking forward to reconnecting!",

It took a lot of resources.\u00b7 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 <PERSON> (their C Talent Officer) suggested contacting us to see how we can help. They put $ in the budget to improve our DEI Report and outsource it.\u00b7 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Looking at expanding it from annual. We\u2019re really doing it every 18 mos but focus on the prior year. For example the one that\u2019s up there now says 2023 but it\u2019s actually from our 2022 activity.\u00b7 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 We need DEI lens to help us bring forth the stories and info that should be in a DEI report.

We need to focus on how we\u2019re keeping people at TH \u2013 focus on retaining the people who are already here. Doesn\u2019t mean that we can\u2019t make our recruiting process more inclusive, for example.

We can definitely appreciate that it takes time to aggregate feedback, thank you.\r\n\r\nYour note below is especially disappointing to hear because:\r\n\r\n  *   I can't find anywhere in the RFP document or in <PERSON>'s email where we were asked to provide detail around trainers and facilitators (name, qualifications, experience, etc.)  Had that been asked of us, we of course would have provided it with the RFP response.\r\n  *   Workshop participant capacity of 50 was a suggestion, and absolutely flexible. Many organizations prefer workshops with even larger groups to save costs, but of course we often facilitate (and recommend) smaller group sizes to maximize learning. 50 is an average group size based on our experience with our clients, but it's always a tradeoff (cost and group size), since the smaller the groups the more numerous the workshops. This is a question that we always leave up to the client.\r\n  *   We have a long history of working closely with BCG's various business units and know you well.\r\n  *   We would have very much welcomed a conversation about costs, to have an opportunity to more closely match the other vendors and also to clarify your questions.\r\n\r\nWe'd welcome any additional info you can provide, including how off our pricing was as compared to the others.\r\n\r\nThanks again for your collaboration in responding to our request!",

What is your opinion on this? Should we club manager and director cohorts, is there a possibility to deliver a training that would make sense covering both cohorts together and justify it or should we cater to them separately? Please suggest\r\n\r\n\r\n  *   Could you please say more about the max 12-16 hours of training? Does that refer to the total time for all sessions for all constituencies? (i.e., all trainings for everyone should be completed within 12-16 hours total time of duration?) Or does it refer to 12-16 hours of training for each of the three constituencies? - Highlighted. These 12-16 hours should majorly comprise of live sessions, training, workshop, immersive learning etc and not self-paced learning. If you offer self-paced modules as well as part of your solution, that could be over and above of this duration but should not go beyond 4-5 hours. That means 12-16 hours of interactive sessions + 4-5 hours of self-learning. This is little flexible and open for discussion if needed\r\n\r\n\r\n  *   We tend to recommend online class sizes to be between 30-40 people. Would this work for you? Or were you looking for larger groups? - We don't really mind having big or small groups as long they are interactive and engaging for everyone. It totally depends on the solution you offer. What is the right number for a group size according to you in such trainings?\r\n\r\n\r\n  *   Will all the workshops be delivered in English? - Yes\r\n\r\n\r\n  *   Were you envisioning creating adapted/different versions of the training for different world regions (NAMR, EMEA, <LOCATION>, APAC)? Or were you thinking of one 'global' version of each training? - Yes, we want to proceed with an idea of capturing the regional essence in the training making it more relatable for the TG. Please be mindful of the cultural differences/ biases while curating the training material\r\n\r\n\r\n  *   Do you have information on the diversity profiles (gender, race, ethnicity, nationality, ages, etc.) of all team members? - We don't keep records of personal information of our employees\r\n\r\n\r\nThat's it for now.\r\n\r\nNot sure if you've received questions from other vendors, but we'd love to see those, with your answers, as well - if possible.\r\n\r\nThank you very much!\r\n<PERSON><PERSON><",

We understand the importance of being a true partner and are excited to announce our exclusive initiative to support our stakeholders by conducting a comprehensive climate interview and survey. The goal of the survey will be to assess how the mindsets and systems within organizations have influenced organizational climate over the past few years and impacted inclusive workplaces. The information we collect from the interview and survey will be treated with utmost confidentiality and the key takeaways will be shared with all selected participants. Based on the key takeaways, we will be sharing relevant resources, developing new content, providing action steps, and offering opportunities to learn and collaborate with peers. \n\nPlease select the time that works best for a 30-minute interview: <URL>\n\nThank you for considering this opportunity.

This 75-minute virtual session, structured similar to our library of spotlights on various communities, is designed to offer valuable insights into the experiences of neurodivergent colleagues and provide practical strategies for fostering an inclusive workplace.\n\nIn this session, you\u2019ll:\nLearn the terminology and models to better understand neurodivergent experiences. Gain insights into the shared cultural experiences of neurodivergent individuals. Acquire actionable strategies to create an inclusive environment for neurodivergent team members. This course not only dives into the definitions and experiences of neurodivergent people but also helps you build an inclusive culture where every neurological difference is respected and celebrated.\n\nWould you be open to discussing how this training can enhance your team's approach to inclusivity? We\u2019d be happy to schedule a meeting in the next week to explore this further.\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you.",

Will the ~90 people be all managers, or a mix of roles (individual contributors and managers/leaders)? Or is it a group of people managers/leaders only?\r\n\r\nAlso, how much time can you give us for the workshop? Is two hours too long?\r\n\r\nWe can deliver the session virtually or in person.\r\n\r\nA two hour session delivered in English, off the shelf (no customizations), with one facilitator will cost:\r\n\r\nVirtual: $6,000\r\nIn person: $10,000 (assume in <LOCATION>?)\r\n\r\nDelivery in <NRP> will also involve translation costs - I can look into about how much that would be.  I will add probably around $2-$3k to the cost.\r\n\r\nThanks so much!\r\n<PERSON><PERSON><",

There was a slight misunderstanding about the workshop name. Based on your suggestion, \"Building a Culture of Inclusion\" sounds like the workshop we're interested in.\r\n\r\nTo give you more information:\r\n\r\n  1.  Workshop Goals: We hope to learn how to make our workplace more inclusive and welcoming.\r\n  2.  Who's Coming: We want the workshop to benefit everyone on our Finance team, no matter their role or level.\r\n  3.  How Many: While we're still figuring out the exact number, we expect around 90 people to attend.\r\n  4.  How We'd Like to Do It: We're happy to do the workshop online, but if it's possible to do it in person, we'd like to explore that, too. Could you provide an option to provide the workshop in Spanish?\r\n\r\nI hope this helps! Feel free to let me know if you need more information or if there's anything else I can do.\r\n\r\nThanks again for your help!",

        "body": "Dear Andr\u00e9s,\u200b\n\nI hope this message finds you well. At XYZ, we are always striving to innovate and provide the most impactful solutions for fostering Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion within organizations. With that commitment in mind, we are excited to introduce our newest training program: The Cross Cultural Learning Partner (CCLP).\n\nWhat makes our CCLP program stand out from traditional DEI training programs? It\u2019s designed to offer a more personalized, in-depth, and continuous learning experience. Here\u2019s how:\nCollaborative Learning: Unlike typical trainings where participants learn individually, CCLP pairs each participant with a learning partner that is culturally different in a significant way. This partnership encourages mutual support and shared growth, making the learning process richer and more effective. The cultural differences between partners offer real, lived scenarios that can be explored through open communication. Extended Engagement: While most DEI sessions are limited to just a few hours, our CCLP program spans 6 to 12 months. This extended timeframe allows for a deeper exploration of cultural competencies, continuous learning, and the opportunity to apply and reflect on insights over time. Real-World Scenarios: CCLP moves beyond hypothetical situations by integrating your unique experiences into the training. This makes the learning more relevant and directly applicable to the challenges and opportunities within your organization. Measurable Growth: Understanding your progress is key to effective learning. CCLP includes pre- and post-assessments, enabling participants to track their development and gain clear insights into how much they\u2019ve grown throughout the program. We believe that our CCLP program offers a transformative approach to DEI training, and we would love to explore how it can benefit your team or organization. If you\u2019re interested in learning more or setting up a time to discuss further, please don\u2019t hesitate to reach out.\n\nLooking forward to connecting!",

I wanted to follow up on my previous email regarding our new Cross Cultural Learning Partner (CCLP) program, as I understand things can get busy. \n\nTo quickly recap, the CCLP program is an innovative and personalized DEI training designed to foster deeper cultural understanding and sustained growth. The Intercultural Development Inventory (IDI) Assessment is a crucial tool within the CCLP program, helping participants not only identify where they are in terms of intercultural competence but also guiding them through the phases of development. Here's how it elevates the training experience: \nUnderstanding Key Developmental Phases: Throughout the program, participants will navigate various phases of intercultural development, progressing from a primarily monocultural perspective to a more inclusive intercultural viewpoint. This understanding is essential for fostering inclusive environments and navigating cultural differences effectively. Targeted Growth: By taking the IDI assessment at the beginning of the program, participants establish a clear baseline of where they currently stand in their intercultural development journey. We follow up with post IDI assessments as well conducted at the end of the program. This allows us to clearly measure the progress they've made, highlighting the growth in their ability to navigate and understand cultural differences more effectively over the 6-12 month program. We\u2019d love to set up a time to discuss how the how the IDI assessment and the CCLP program can be implemented to meet your team\u2019s needs. Please let me know what week works best, and I can send over some times to connect. \n\nLooking forward to your response.",

I know we have a meeting in the books for Monday, which is great. If we could have a decision by Monday (or earlier!), that would be ideal. It's still a much tighter timeframe than is typical, but probably doable. We communicated with our <LOCATION>-based facilitator as soon as we finished our last meeting, but do you happen to have the timeslot  for this particular session?",

I look forward to speaking with you.\u201dPwC Canada110-year history, 7,700+ partners and staff are located coast to coastAudit and assurance, tax, deals, and consulting targeting solutions for cybersecurity, privacy, financial crime, workforce of the future, finance transformation, value creation, strategic reassessment and cost optimization. CALL NOTES:Joined PwC 2 years ago, came from BCG and IBMIn Montreal, my role is pan CanadianIn 2014, PwC acquired Booz & Company (changed its name to \u201cStrategy&\u201d)In <LOCATION> grown organically, verticallyWe have 75 ppl (22 women), including 14 partners (2 women) in this Strategy Canada groupSeeking help with gender \u2013 has done surveysDid performance reviews, we have an HR person there who participates in all the assessments. Similar to BCG process (RP: CDC \u2013 Career Development Committee, was BCG\u2019s process).Worried about growth of female talent. We studied the performance eval data and what came out was that, for women, there is a bigger concentration within the average vs. in excellent / outstanding. [RP1] We can\u2019t argue about quality of female talent bc 22 is a pretty significant number and performance s/be closer to a normal distributionIs there bias? Not sureAre there ERGs? Not in this <LOCATION> bc we\u2019re considered too <URL>ople not being super empathetic around differences, managing diversity. I got through quite a few trainings at BCG (2007-2019). We were taught about the differences between genders. Caring and connectivity. Most of the partners haven\u2019t experienced <URL>st of us know about the theories and concepts, but not about the differences. We need more in the room, role plays, <URL> root cause performance review process, or is it before the perf reviews, in the day to day work?\u00b7 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 We had UB training right before the review process btw.\u00b7 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Some of the behaviors I\u2019ve seen are \u2018cowboyish\u2019.

What I\u2019m worried about is bare bones \u2013 like hiring, esp at the more senior level. And growing and retaining women. How do we address inclusion and belonging? We also don\u2019t want to engage in reverse discrimination.RP: we\u2019d Look at engagement survey data, conduct interviews or focus groupsRP: What\u2019s the difference between Strategy and consulting? Grown a lot in 2022-23. We\u2019ve been stagnant in the last year, consulting has been hit a little hard. We\u2019re part of Consulting, but we have our own thing \u2013 like Platinion or Gamma, separate legal entity. In <LOCATION> in the <LOCATION> we\u2019re part of consulting (\u2018advisory\u2019). I was one of the two <LOCATION>\u2019s that started Platinion. I loved the firm.RP notes:\u00b7 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 We need to set the stage for people to be open to listening to the issues, and to engage in adaptations.\u00b7 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 People need to see their perspectives as cultural \u2013 not as \u2018this is the best way to work and women need to adapt\u2019.We don\u2019t see <LOCATION> as an extension to the <LOCATION> \u2013 even through we\u2019re based here we\u2019re sensitive that we need to have our <LOCATION> cultural lens <URL><PERSON> post call debrief: usually these things are driven by women so it\u2019s great that he\u2019s driving this <URL>xt steps:\u00b7 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Send them info about XYZ, consulting projects, building IC and practice based trainings\u00b7 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Include some things that we didn\u2019t get to tell him [RP1]Why?

We\u2019ve never had that.RP: IDI assessment?Fabrice: We want practice, like with role playing. Scenarios that involve giving feedback on a specific project for example. RP: DIN model <URL>e cases \u2013 one is more immediate, partner session on June 11th , one hour of the time to this topic. Hands on role <URL>en later, Part 2 project \u2013 This collaboration can be more project based, like maybe an assessment. We\u2019d want to include partners, directors, and senior managers. Provide them with timelines and costs.About our organization:Last couple of years has added to the gender imbalance.We\u2019re sitting as 3 industry verticals as opposed to the one S& team.S& has biweekly huddles, the partner and director groups get together to talk about common things. But attendance has dropped, ppl aren\u2019t showing up bc reward and assessment feels more vertically aligned.But end of year performance assessments are done a group of 3 \u2013 the whole S&. So there\u2019s a disconnect between how we\u2019re showing up day to day (as one section) vs. during appraisals (as one organization).Fabrice is trying to bring us together more often as one cohesive S& firm.Fabrice said he didn\u2019t think any of the men realized that no women were ranked as \u2018tier 1\u2019, all the chair 1 rankings this year were white men. We have non-white men, we have women at S&.There\u2019s nothing that I can point to at CRT\u2019s that was done inappropriately, but it\u2019s manifesting itself at CRTs (Career Round Table is the name of the end-of-year performance <LOCATION> female partners in S& (<NRP> and <PERSON>). <PERSON> is not seen as Strategy&, in a day to day way. Strategy and CRT\u2019s are attended by <PERSON> and 10 or 11 <URL>le partners - half are new, others \u2013 I don\u2019t think it\u2019s the old school behaviors (they\u2019re in 40s/early 50s Gen X) but I think that there\u2019s still some inherent bias. \u00a0For example, I made partner remotely. 10 days after my kid came out of the NICU, I was on the call advocating for myself to achieve partnership. I\u2019ve always been in this position, for better or worse I\u2019ve normalized this <URL> do we open everyone\u2019s eyes that there is a bit of a problem and here are some very tactical ways for how this is manifesting on your team. For example, when we get on calls, there\u2019s usually 5 min of banter among the men mostly, while people are joining. Men make well intended derogatory comments towaredds each other, teasing each other (\u201care you really working or are you\u2026\u201d automatically alienates the women \u00a0- bc that\u2019s not our style and we\u2019re excluded. The men haven\u2019t behaved inappropriately towards the women, but the outcome is, women are not <URL><PERSON> done nothing that\u2019s a compliance violation it\u2019s beyond, it\u2019s about inclusion. I can help you write 4 or 5 scenarios. I don\u2019t want this to be a check the box exercise or a compliance exercise \u2013 I want this to be a cultural conversation for us.If someone isn\u2019t speaking a language fluently, concerns arise. \u00a0What kind of situation helps make it better? Is it better to know employee beyond the project, but for example there was a woman who got engaged. A woman got engaged, but men didn\u2019t mention it to me when she came up. Remind them the benefits of relationship building and how that has a big impact on how people show up on projects. The downstream impacts of our behavior. Vignettes would be helpful. It\u2019s not about censoring yourself or changing who you are.June 11 \u2013 in <LOCATION>? \u00a0And it\u2019s about talking about how men and women are socialized \u2013 and about having conversations. Women feeling safe and comfortable bringing things up and men feeling safe asking questions and making <URL>thing documented, but I have had chats with more vocal ppl managers who are coming up to the senior ranks. Something is wrong but I can\u2019t tell what it is.RP thoughts:\u00b7 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 How do women feel about bringing issues up? Are there potential negative consequences?\u00b7 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Also, what\u2019s considered excellent performance?

At XYZ, we are always striving to innovate and provide the most impactful solutions for fostering Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion within organizations. With that commitment in mind, we are excited to introduce our newest training program: The Cross Cultural Learning Partner (CCLP).\n\nWhat makes our CCLP program stand out from traditional DEI training programs? It\u2019s designed to offer a more personalized, in-depth, and continuous learning experience. Here\u2019s how:\nCollaborative Learning: Unlike typical trainings where participants learn individually, CCLP pairs each participant with a learning partner that is culturally different in a significant way. This partnership encourages mutual support and shared growth, making the learning process richer and more effective. The cultural differences between partners offer real, lived scenarios that can be explored through open communication. Extended Engagement: While most DEI sessions are limited to just a few hours, our CCLP program spans 6 to 12 months. This extended timeframe allows for a deeper exploration of cultural competencies, continuous learning, and the opportunity to apply and reflect on insights over time. Real-World Scenarios: CCLP moves beyond hypothetical situations by integrating your unique experiences into the training. This makes the learning more relevant and directly applicable to the challenges and opportunities within your organization. Measurable Growth: Understanding your progress is key to effective learning. CCLP includes pre- and post-assessments, enabling participants to track their development and gain clear insights into how much they\u2019ve grown throughout the program. We believe that our CCLP program offers a transformative approach to DEI training, and we would love to explore how it can benefit your team or organization. If you\u2019re interested in learning more or setting up a time to discuss further, please don\u2019t hesitate to reach out.\n\nLooking forward to connecting!",

        "body": "Hello Anna,\u200b \n\nI hope you're doing well. I wanted to follow up on my previous email regarding our Cross Cultural Learning Partner (CCLP) program, as I understand things can get busy. \n\nTo quickly recap, the CCLP program is an innovative and personalized DEI training designed to foster deeper cultural understanding and sustained growth. The Intercultural Development Inventory (IDI) Assessment is a crucial tool within the CCLP program, helping participants not only identify where they are in terms of intercultural competence but also guiding them through the phases of development. Here's how it elevates the training experience: \nUnderstanding Key Developmental Phases: Throughout the program, participants will navigate various phases of intercultural development, progressing from a primarily monocultural perspective to a more inclusive intercultural viewpoint. This understanding is essential for fostering inclusive environments and navigating cultural differences effectively. Targeted Growth: By taking the IDI assessment at the beginning of the program, participants establish a clear baseline of where they currently stand in their intercultural development journey. We follow up with post IDI assessments as well conducted at the end of the program. This allows us to clearly measure the progress they've made, highlighting the growth in their ability to navigate and understand cultural differences more effectively over the 6-12 month program. We\u2019d love to set up a time to discuss how the IDI assessment and the CCLP program can be implemented to meet your team\u2019s needs. Please let me know what week works best, and I can send over some times to connect. \n\nLooking forward to your response.",

These sessions do not explain or resolve current geopolitical events, do not advocate particular points of view or debate history, and like all of our Spotlights, aim to build cultural competence and understanding.\r\n\r\nAttached are overviews of the agendas for each 75-min session.\r\n\r\nWe are absolutely open to working with you to create a <NRP> context-focused version of these sessions.

        "body": "Hello <PERSON> \n\nI hope you're doing well. I wanted to follow up on my previous email regarding our Cross Cultural Learning Partner (CCLP) program, as I understand things can get busy. \n\nTo quickly recap, the CCLP program is an innovative and personalized DEI training designed to foster deeper cultural understanding and sustained growth. The Intercultural Development Inventory (IDI) Assessment is a crucial tool within the CCLP program, helping participants not only identify where they are in terms of intercultural competence but also guiding them through the phases of development. Here's how it elevates the training experience: \nUnderstanding Key Developmental Phases: Throughout the program, participants will navigate various phases of intercultural development, progressing from a primarily monocultural perspective to a more inclusive intercultural viewpoint. This understanding is essential for fostering inclusive environments and navigating cultural differences effectively. Targeted Growth: By taking the IDI assessment at the beginning of the program, participants establish a clear baseline of where they currently stand in their intercultural development journey. We follow up with post IDI assessments as well conducted at the end of the program. This allows us to clearly measure the progress they've made, highlighting the growth in their ability to navigate and understand cultural differences more effectively over the 6-12 month program. We\u2019d love to set up a time to discuss how the IDI assessment and the CCLP program can be implemented to meet your team\u2019s needs. Please let me know what week works best, and I can send over some times to connect. \n\nLooking forward to your response.",

        "body": "Dear Kelly,\u200b\n\nI hope this message finds you well. At XYZ, we are always striving to innovate and provide the most impactful solutions for fostering Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion within organizations. With that commitment in mind, we are excited to introduce our updated and elevated training program: The Cross Cultural Learning Partner (CCLP).\n\nWhat makes our CCLP program stand out from traditional DEI training programs? It\u2019s designed to offer a more personalized, in-depth, and continuous learning experience. Here\u2019s how:\nCollaborative Learning: Unlike typical trainings where participants learn individually, CCLP pairs each participant with a learning partner that is culturally different in a significant way. This partnership encourages mutual support and shared growth, making the learning process richer and more effective. The cultural differences between partners offer real, lived scenarios that can be explored through open communication. Extended Engagement: While most DEI sessions are limited to just a few hours, our CCLP program spans 6 to 12 months. This extended timeframe allows for a deeper exploration of cultural competencies, continuous learning, and the opportunity to apply and reflect on insights over time. Real-World Scenarios: CCLP moves beyond hypothetical situations by integrating your unique experiences into the training. This makes the learning more relevant and directly applicable to the challenges and opportunities within your organization. Measurable Growth: Understanding your progress is key to effective learning. CCLP includes pre- and post-assessments, enabling participants to track their development and gain clear insights into how much they\u2019ve grown after the program. We believe that our CCLP program offers a transformative approach to DEI training, and we would love to explore how it can benefit your team or organization. If you\u2019re interested in learning more or setting up a time to discuss further, please don\u2019t hesitate to reach out.\n\nLooking forward to connecting!",

That would require some basic customization. Customizations start at $750, depending on the level of design and development required.\r\n\r\nIf the core of the question is do we talk about how Islamophobia impacts those who may not be <NRP> but present in ways that people might confuse with being <NRP>, we do. We talk specifically about the effects of discrimination on <NRP> and those perceived to be <NRP> but the course is really anchored in identifying and interrupting <PERSON>, as well as unpacking and exploring the contributions of <NRP> to the culture.\r\n\r\nLet me know if you have any additional questions.\r\n\r\n<PERSON>Please Note: Honoring the need for work/life balance, XYZ will be closed for Winter Break from December 24 through January 1st.

Do we send to you and/or <PERSON>, or is there a different person/department?\r\n     *   The above notes the process for email and then you\u2019ll cc <PERSON> to help track.\r\n  *   Finally, what are you payment terms? Our preference is net 30 days as we\u2019re a small business that relies on receiving payment quickly in order to keep running effectively. Would that be okay?\r\n     *   With a new vendor it can be net-45 but we aim for net-30.\r\n\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the below communications are helpful but just a flag there is the likelihood some folks will fill the assessment out late given holiday and just this being a new meeting type \u2013 we will of course push hard to avoid this but in the chance, it does is there any alternative plan?",

today. A couple of questions first if you don\u2019t\u2019 mind:\r\n\r\n  *   When we invoice you, is there a PO number or charge code we\u2019ll need to include, and if so, would you be able to provide that to us?\r\n  *   What is your invoicing process? Do we send to you and/or <PERSON>, or is there a different person/department?\r\n  *   Finally, what are you payment terms? Our preference is net 30 days as we\u2019re a small business that relies on receiving payment quickly in order to keep running effectively. Would that be okay?\r\n\r\nThank you!\r\n<PERSON><PERSON><",

You will get IDI assessment description and communication to go your team.\r\n  2.  Each person receiving an assessment will get clear instructions how to access assessment and deadline to complete it.\r\n  3.  Session being July 25 for IDI group debrief session, we usually like to get ALL assessments completed 7-10 days prior to session, so getting all names and emails for the 25 individuals by Monday July 8th would be ideal to give your team 7 days including the weekend to complete the assessment. July 15th sound good as it those who may need a reminder to complete it in ample time. How does that sound?\r\n  4.  You will also receive a separate description of  IDI group debrief session (July 25) and  the BCI session  (August date TBD) to prepare your announcement and invitation to those who will attend the respective sessions. I will send them within 48hrs.\r\n\r\nLet me know if you have any questions,",

        "body": "Hi <PERSON>,\r\n\r\nWe are good to move forward with the proposal. We are also locked in for Thursday, July 25 from 12 to 1:30 PM ET. Please let us know if that works for <PERSON>.  <PERSON> is available between 2-4pm EST on that day. If that time doesn\u2019t work, please let us know and <PERSON> will assign a different Qualified IDI Certified Facilitator.\r\n\r\n\r\nA few questions \u2013\r\n\r\n1)Outside of payment, what else is needed to get the survey sent? We need first /last names and email addresses of the 25 people that will take the IDI assessment.\r\n\r\n\r\n2) Would it be possible to record any of the trainings? We know this is more of an introductory session, but most clients are scheduling multiple sessions live because; We do believe that the most impactful and enriching learning happens in the live sessions where participants can respond to the materials and ask questions of experienced DEI practitioners about the content. Watching the static recording will not resonate the same for all potential learners. In short, it will be a lesser experience. I also want to ensure that Link Logistics would be okay with recording and distributing to the rest of the organization the comments and questions that might be asked in the safe space of the live session. It will be a dynamic environment. The concern is others taking comments/questions advanced by your staff in the live session out of context or mischaracterizing them for their own partisan purposes. There is risk.\r\n\r\nIf you still decide that a recording of your session is needed the cost will be as follows:\r\nWeekly access: $2,500 per week\r\nPerpetual access: $25,000 (you will be provided the recording to place on your LMS)\r\nOf course, we would initiate and manage the recording of the session and the subsequent recorded file.\r\n\r\n3) Would XYZ also be open to being mentioned in external communications such as our ESG report? YES! OF COURSE. XYZ would also love to promote the ESG report on our own social media too!\r\n\r\nI\u2019m cc\u2019ing Grace, department head, who will help run point on any of the PO / invoicing while I\u2019m out next week.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\n[cid:<URL>g@01DACD60.47C99A40]<",

while you are out.\r\n\r\nWe did have a final point of clarification, since the second group of 25 folks will not be partaking in the IDI debrief, we were planning to include their data in the first groups debrief. Does that work for you? So, 50 IDI completed before 7/14 and the debrief of all 50 would be delivered to the 25 leaders on 7/25. We cannot provide scores to folks without a debrief so the best way to provide all scores is to capture them prior to the first session and include them in that discussion. Once you confirm this final point, we will send you the proposal.\r\n\r\nPlease give me a call, if you want to briefly discuss <PHONE_NUMBER>.\r\n\r\n<PERSON>",

        "body": "Hi <PERSON> back, in blue my answers.\r\n\r\n\r\n  1.  I am listed as \u2018key personnel\u2019 and project manager. Your main contact will be the XYZ Consultant assigned to the Colgate Palmolive account. This one may not be that big a deal, but wanted to let you know it will not be me.  It's OK, please let us know who is the Consultant assigned to our project.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  1.  The cost of the building of the new microlearning, \u201cManaging Bias in Compensation & Recognition\u201d is not included in the SOW. This cost was $25k, as detailed in the proposal we shared with you and the XYZ SOW I wrote up and sent y\u2019all on May 6th. The SOW does state \u201cOnce Supplier develops a 6th microlearning, \u2018Managing Bias in Compensation & Recognition\u2019, it will be included in this library total at no additional cost\u201d \u2013 which is true as it pertains to the subscription fees, but not the design and development fee of $25k which we had previously discussed. We are NOT targeting this course for this year. A new SOW will be needed in 2025 to create the  \u201cManaging Bias in Compensation & Recognition\u201d micro learning.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  1.  The SOW says \u201cEdits to pre-existing microlearning courses, as per Company's requests\u201d @ $3500. In the XYZ SOW I sent ion May 6th, I had included a list of the precise edits that we agreed to and priced out for you. This list was not included in the SOW that was signed, instead it says \u201cEdits to pre-existing microlearning courses, as per Company's requests\u201d, leaving it rather open. I know during our recent meetings with our Translation head we talked about this- depending on the extent of any additional changes, there may be an additional cost. The specific changes we had previously agreed to were:\r\n\r\n     *   Overall for all microlearnings: Ensure images throughout show broad diversity (gender, race, age, abilities, etc.) and ensure participants cannot skip content.\r\n     *   Managing <PERSON> in Recruiting: Lesson 2: Ensure participants read all items in the 'Things you can say to support inclusive recruiting' thought bubbles.\r\n     *   Managing <PERSON> in Hiring: A. Lesson 1 video: Edit out the phrase \"...who in many cases will be women\u201d from voiceover; B. Lesson 2 'Tips for interrupting and mitigating the effects of unconscious bias during the hiring process\": Ensure participants read all the tips (1-7) and edit onscreen text in Tip #5 (substitute debate team example with more globally relatable example)\r\n     *   Managing <PERSON> in Interviewing: Lesson 2: In the \"What can you do?' section, under \u201cImplicit Stereotyping Bias\u201d, substitute example in fourth bullet\r\n     *   Managing Bias in Performance Reviews: No changes other than 'overall' edits mentioned at the top of this list.\r\n     *   Managing Bias in Talent Review: A. Lesson 2: Replace the image of all the women with an image that is more diverse (currently photo is all women of color \u2013 we want to make sure that photo includes white women/people). B. Lesson 3: Replace <PERSON> quote with <PERSON> quote: \u201cBeing 100% sure of yourself at all times betrays arrogance and breeds complacency. Questioning yourself reflects humility and propels growth.\u201d\r\n\r\n Yes, these are the changes we are targeting. If any additional is required, we will need to revisit at the time.\r\n\r\n  1.  The translation of the new microlearning (the one we haven\u2019t built yet) into the five languages is NOT reflected in the signed SOW. That would be an additional $15k ($3k per language). We are not targeting the course nor the translation for this year as I mentioned in bullet #2.\r\n\r\n\r\n  1.  So, $25k + $15k = $40k is missing from the signed SOW. Costs reflect what actually we are targeting for 2024.\r\n  2.  Regarding the meeting on Friday, July 5th, please propose a date/ time for the week of July 15th.\r\n\r\nOn Mon, Jul 1, 2024 at 4:19\u202fPM <PERSON> <<EMAIL_ADDRESS><mailto:<EMAIL_ADDRESS>>> wrote:\r\nHi <PERSON> and <PERSON>, how are you?\r\n\r\nI\u2019m back from my PTO from last week, and I see that while I was gone the SOW was sent over and signed by <PERSON>, our CEO, which is excellent! We\u2019re so very much looking forward to working with you!\r\n\r\nHowever, as I review the signed SOW, I see a few things that may warrant revision:\r\n\r\n\r\n  1.  I am listed as \u2018key personnel\u2019 and project manager. Your main contact will be the XYZ Consultant assigned to the Colgate Palmolive account. This one may not be that big a deal, but wanted to let you know it will not be me.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  1.

Should an amendment to the signed SOW be drafted and signed?\r\n\r\nAlso, I see a meeting was scheduled for Friday morning, I\u2019m actually OOO that day. Plus the kickoff meeting should also include your XYZ Consultant. I\u2019ll have to see who has been assigned to you and introduce you.",

        "body": "Dear Sandra,\u200b\n\nI hope this message finds you well. At XYZ, we are always striving to innovate and provide the most impactful solutions for fostering Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion within organizations. With that commitment in mind, we are excited to introduce our updated and elevated training program: The Cross Cultural Learning Partner (CCLP).\n\nWhat makes our CCLP program stand out from traditional DEI training programs? It\u2019s designed to offer a more personalized, in-depth, and continuous learning experience. Here\u2019s how:\nCollaborative Learning: Unlike typical trainings where participants learn individually, CCLP pairs each participant with a learning partner that is culturally different in a significant way. This partnership encourages mutual support and shared growth, making the learning process richer and more effective. The cultural differences between partners offer real, lived scenarios that can be explored through open communication. Extended Engagement: While most DEI sessions are limited to just a few hours, our CCLP program spans 6 to 12 months. This extended timeframe allows for a deeper exploration of cultural competencies, continuous learning, and the opportunity to apply and reflect on insights over time. Real-World Scenarios: CCLP moves beyond hypothetical situations by integrating your unique experiences into the training. This makes the learning more relevant and directly applicable to the challenges and opportunities within your organization. Measurable Growth: Understanding your progress is key to effective learning. CCLP includes pre- and post-assessments, enabling participants to track their development and gain clear insights into how much they\u2019ve grown after the program. We believe that our CCLP program offers a transformative approach to DEI training, and we would love to explore how it can benefit your team or organization. If you\u2019re interested in learning more or setting up a time to discuss further, please don\u2019t hesitate to reach out.\n\nLooking forward to connecting!",

I wanted to follow up on my previous email regarding our Cross Cultural Learning Partner (CCLP) program, as I understand things can get busy. \n\nTo quickly recap, the CCLP program is an innovative and personalized DEI training designed to foster deeper cultural understanding and sustained growth. The Intercultural Development Inventory (IDI) Assessment is a crucial tool within the CCLP program, helping participants not only identify where they are in terms of intercultural competence but also guiding them through the phases of development. Here's how it elevates the training experience: \nUnderstanding Key Developmental Phases: Throughout the program, participants will navigate various phases of intercultural development, progressing from a primarily monocultural perspective to a more inclusive intercultural viewpoint. This understanding is essential for fostering inclusive environments and navigating cultural differences effectively. Targeted Growth: By taking the IDI assessment at the beginning of the program, participants establish a clear baseline of where they currently stand in their intercultural development journey. We follow up with post IDI assessments as well conducted at the end of the program. This allows us to clearly measure the progress they've made, highlighting the growth in their ability to navigate and understand cultural differences more effectively over the 6-12 month program. We\u2019d love to set up a time to discuss how the how the IDI assessment and the CCLP program can be implemented to meet your team\u2019s needs. Please let me know what week works best, and I can send over some times to connect. \n\nLooking forward to your response.",

First, as I am reviewing original SOW to determine budget. I see that tittle is \u201cManaging Bias in Compensation & Recognition\" vs \u201cRewards & Recognition\u201d. The latter came up during our last call. Recognition=Praises, email, public announcements but Rewards= Tangible perks in addition to salary. When discuss goals, objectives and outcomes expected we can confirm. I will say we should  keep the title as Managing Bias in Rewards & Recogntion\" since internally we usually talk about Rewards & Recognition and not Compensation & Recognition but  we will definitely discuss the  specific content to be included.\r\n\r\n2.   We spoke about <US_DRIVER_LICENSE> to work on this ML. Do you have launch date in mind in <US_DRIVER_LICENSE> or <US_DRIVER_LICENSE>? The sooner the better , so ideally <US_DRIVER_LICENSE> still not an specific date\r\n\r\n3.   Who will benefit from this ML, current employees, or new hire ONLY? Current employees\r\n\r\n@Jesma Johnson<mailto:<EMAIL_ADDRESS>> any additional comment ?",

I was focusing on the demo on Tuesday and it completely escaped my mind, my apologies!\r\n\r\nAt any rate, attached is a short proposal, laying out our understanding of your need and what we propose. Please let me know if there\u2019s anything I can clarify for you.\r\n\r\nOur heart, soul, and purpose, since we were founded in 2000, has been to help develop the mindsets and systems needed to foster resilient, diverse, and equitable teams that will be successful in a cross-cultural world. At the heart of our expertise is approaching DEIB through a cultural competence-based lens. The foundation of our \u201cculture first\u201d approach is that we all belong to many different cultures- of nationality, race, generation, gender identity, abilities, religion, geographic region, educational background, socioeconomic background, and many more \u2013 at the same time. And each of those cultures are formed by particular experiences and influences in our lives, which have led us to certain core values and outward demonstrations of those values (behaviors) as being the \u2018best\u2019 and \u2018most effective\u2019. When we intentionally try to understand these experiences, influences, and values (in ourselves and others), we gain crucial insight into understanding, appreciating, navigating, and bridging behaviors that we may not initially be used to \u2013 and given those insights we can and will work much more effectively.\r\n\r\nIf what you see in this proposal is only almost right for your needs, then we look forward to hearing from you so that we can respond swiftly, make adjustments, and get you what you need to ensure alignment.\r\n\r\nAgain, we\u2019re extremely interested in developing a relationship with BNP Paribas, and in becoming one of your trusted DEIB and intercultural training and consulting advisors and partners.\r\n\r\nLooking forward to Tuesday!\r\n<PERSON><PERSON><",

The program starts off with a reminder of how and why intercultural competence and inclusion are building blocks for high performance and innovation. Participants explore the powerful role that culture plays in shaping and driving behavior and expectations in the workplace. A model for identifying and navigating cultural differences will be introduced, as well as with frameworks for identifying, understanding, and seeing the value of differences in their teams. The program also covers recognizing and countering microinequities while validating their colleagues\u2019 backgrounds and experiences. Case studies, activities, and other interactions are leveraged to help participants apply learning and build skills to successfully identify and optimize differences. By the end of the workshop, participants will have tools to model behaviors that create an inclusive culture to develop deeper relationships and promote greater productivity, collaboration, and breakthrough thinking at BNP Paribas.",

Not sure if I learned anything NEW. Definitely a relevant subject for today's day and age, but for the highly qualified individuals BNP employs, I'm afraid the information provided is likely not new/helping employees truly GROW.\"\r\n  *   \"The course actually does a good job of thinking about DEI&B critically, and I think would be very conducive to in-person learning\"\r\n  *   \"I think this just missed the mark, but the idea behind it seemed almost there, the instructor seemed to have a disconnect with the audience.\"\r\n  *   \"In my opinion, this course will have a hard time engaging AATPs given the pace of the class, the amount of participation required for \"basic\" things. I would recommend a more serious and objective presentation, showing new information. Especially given that a lot of the material presented is already talked about in college. The bottom line is that I don't think you will get the type of engagement, interest and focus as one would expect from the AATPs.\"\r\n\r\nI understand the training is meant to be in-person vs the demo we held virtually, but I don't think the training is exactly what we had in mind for this summer induction training. The price you quoted for the one day engagement is also a bit out of the budget of our Early Careers team. We would love to keep you in mind for future opportunities though.",

I'd love to chat more about our summer AATP Induction. I'm happy to meet with you tomorrow or Friday. If not I can make your Tuesday at 11:30am or 12pm timeslot. A bit more about the what we are looking for:\r\n\r\nEvery summer BNP Paribas welcomes over a hundred full time staff members as a part of the Analyst and Associate Training Program (AATP) for a week long training and orientation. These individuals are junior staff who have just graduated from their undergraduate or Master's program and this is likely their first job. This year, we would like to include interactive DEIB conversations into their summer induction program and I wanted to inquire about what that could look like and the cost involved. I'd like to center the conversation around cultural humility and awareness of social identity. This is important as BNP Paribas is a global bank and it is common practice to interact across countries/cultures on a daily basis. We want to emphasize and encourage them to keep a sense of openness as they enter the bank and give them the awareness of the social identities they bring to the workplace every day in order to better work with their colleagues.  Building their awareness of unconscious biases and helping to shape attitudes that make BNPP a place where people feel comfortable sharing their voice.\r\n\r\nSome additional relevant information:\r\n# of participants: 80-85 per session (total around 165), we would be splitting the group in half for the day, so they would either have this in the morning or in the afternoon. Majority of participants would be from the <LOCATION>, but we would also have some flying in from <LOCATION>, LatAM, and <LOCATION>.\r\nDate: Tuesday, July 23rd 2024\r\nTime: First session 9am-12pm and the second session would be 1:30pm-4:30pm participants would either be assigned to the first or second session.\r\nLocation: NYC Convene location at 117 West 46th Street\r\n\r\nHappy to answer any questions you have.

I'd love to chat more about our summer AATP Induction. I'm happy to meet with you tomorrow or Friday. If not I can make your Tuesday at 11:30am or 12pm timeslot. A bit more about the what we are looking for:\r\n\r\nEvery summer BNP Paribas welcomes over a hundred full time staff members as a part of the Analyst and Associate Training Program (AATP) for a week long training and orientation. These individuals are junior staff who have just graduated from their undergraduate or Master's program and this is likely their first job. This year, we would like to include interactive DEIB conversations into their summer induction program and I wanted to inquire about what that could look like and the cost involved. I'd like to center the conversation around cultural humility and awareness of social identity. This is important as BNP Paribas is a global bank and it is common practice to interact across countries/cultures on a daily basis. We want to emphasize and encourage them to keep a sense of openness as they enter the bank and give them the awareness of the social identities they bring to the workplace every day in order to better work with their colleagues.  Building their awareness of unconscious biases and helping to shape attitudes that make BNPP a place where people feel comfortable sharing their voice.\r\n\r\nSome additional relevant information:\r\n# of participants: 80-85 per session (total around 165), we would be splitting the group in half for the day, so they would either have this in the morning or in the afternoon. Majority of participants would be from the <LOCATION>, but we would also have some flying in from <LOCATION>, LatAM, and <LOCATION>.\r\nDate: Tuesday, July 23rd 2024\r\nTime: First session 9am-12pm and the second session would be 1:30pm-4:30pm participants would either be assigned to the first or second session.\r\nLocation: NYC Convene location at 117 West 46th Street\r\n\r\nHappy to answer any questions you have.

        "body": "Hi, <PERSON>,\r\nThank you for your extreme patience with our reply.\r\n\r\nWe could build a microlearning, similar in design as the ones you already have, which upskills managers on developing, coaching, and helping their neurodivergent team members feel like their contributions matter and that they belong in the team and at the company.\r\n\r\nAn example outline of what such a microlearning or microlearning series would include:\r\n\r\n\r\n  1.  Introduction to Neurodiversity\r\n     *   Discuss the importance of creating an inclusive culture at Rockwell.\r\n     *   Define neurodiversity and its importance in the workplace: <NRP> people think, process information, and learn differently as compared to those who are neurotypical.\r\n     *   Explain the various forms of neurodivergence: Examples of neurodivergence include the autism spectrum, ADHD, traumatic brain injury, Down syndrome, Tourette syndrome, dyslexia, <PERSON>, dysgraphia, sensory processing disorders, or other intellectual disabilities. \u201cNeurodiversity\u201d describes the entire spectrum of ways in which human beings think, process information, and learn. All neurological variations should be respected and celebrated, and are part of the normal range of human diversity.\r\n     *   Discuss common myths and misconceptions.\r\n  2.  Understanding Neurodivergent Perspectives\r\n     *   Explore how neurodivergent individuals may experience the workplace differently.\r\n     *   Provide insights into how neurodivergent individuals tend to think, process information, and learn.\r\n     *   Share personal stories or snippets from neurodivergent individuals at Rockwell (if available) or others.\r\n  3.  Communication and Feedback\r\n     *   Provide guidance on effective communication strategies when working with neurodivergent team members.\r\n     *   Emphasize the importance of clear and direct communication.\r\n     *   Offer tips for providing constructive feedback tailored to individual needs and preferences.\r\n  4.  Developing and Coaching Neurodivergent Team Members\r\n     *   Discuss strategies for recognizing and leveraging the strengths of neurodivergent team members.\r\n     *   Provide guidance on setting realistic goals and expectations.\r\n     *   Offer coaching techniques that accommodate different learning styles and preferences.\r\n  5.  Navigating Challenges\r\n     *   Address common challenges that may arise when working with neurodivergent team members.\r\n     *   Provide strategies for addressing misunderstandings and potential sources of tension\r\n     *   Emphasize the importance of self-awareness, intercultural competence, curiosity, and flexibility in resolving issues.\r\n     *   Discuss how to work collaboratively with neurodivergent team members to identify needs and provide support.\r\n  6.  Promoting Belonging and Recognition\r\n     *   Discuss the importance of ensuring that neurodivergent team members feel valued, included, and appreciated.\r\n     *   Provide tips for promoting a sense of belonging and recognition within the team and the company.\r\n     *   Highlight the role of managers in advocating for the needs and contributions of neurodivergent team members.\r\n  7.  Resources and Further Support\r\n     *   Provide information on additional resources, support networks, and organizations focused on neurodiversity.\r\n     *   Offer guidance on where to find additional training at Rockwell, related to supporting neurodivergent individuals (eg., HR pertaining to reasonable accommodations, other DEI training/resources, ERG).\r\n\r\nThe course will have elements of interactivity, videos, an action planning element, and a downloadable pdf with key takeaways.\r\n\r\nThe cost for the build would be $35k. It includes a perpetual, unlimited site license.\r\n\r\nA general ballpark timeline would be 8 weeks. I can get back to you with a more precise timeline if you\u2019d like me to.\r\n\r\nWarmly,\r\n<PERSON><PERSON><",

Understanding People with Disabilities: This program was developed to promote awareness of disabilities in the workplace. It can stand alone or be part of a broader manager or employee development program. Many clients customize it to reflect their values, corporate culture, or even include a message from their CEO. We could also expand the course to enhance the focus on neurodiversity, which has been of increasing interest to several clients. Here is the link to review the content: <URL><<URL>>\r\n\r\n\r\n  1.  Sample of \"Empowering Diversity, Equity & Inclusion (DEI) for Excellence\": This module was tailored for a specific client, but we can provide a sample version, excluding client details, to give you a sense of how we approach developing custom content. We can have this ready and have a link sent by next Tuesday.\r\n\r\nRegarding budget, the figures are as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n  *   Disability standalone microlearning: $14K\r\n  *   Disability microlearning with enhanced neurodiversity section: $18K\r\n  *   Development of a similar \"Empowering DEI for Excellence\" module: $20K\r\n\r\nPlease let us know if you have any questions or would like to explore further customization options.\r\n\r\nWishing you a wonderful weekend!",

We want to ensure you have the information you need for your internal discussions, so here are two examples of XYZ\u2019s digital learning approach:\r\n\r\n\r\n  1.  Understanding People with Disabilities: This program was developed to promote awareness of disabilities in the workplace. It can stand alone or be part of a broader manager or employee development program. Many clients customize it to reflect their values, corporate culture, or even include a message from their CEO. We could also expand the course to enhance the focus on neurodiversity, which has been of increasing interest to several clients. Here is the link to review the content: <URL><<URL>>\r\n\r\n\r\n  1.  Sample of \u201cEmpowering Diversity, Equity & Inclusion (DEI) for Excellence\u201d: This module was tailored for a specific client, but we can provide a sample version, excluding client details, to give you a sense of how we approach developing custom content. We can have this ready and have a link sent by next Tuesday.\r\n\r\nRegarding budget, the figures are as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n  *   Disability standalone microlearning: $14K\r\n  *   Disability microlearning with enhanced neurodiversity section: $18K\r\n  *   Development of a similar \u201cEmpowering DEI for Excellence\u201d module: $20K\r\n\r\nPlease let us know if you have any questions or would like to explore further customization options.\r\n\r\nWishing you a wonderful weekend!",

I wanted to follow up on my previous email regarding our Cross Cultural Learning Partner (CCLP) program, as I understand things can get busy. \n\nTo quickly recap, the CCLP program is an innovative and personalized DEI training designed to foster deeper cultural understanding and sustained growth. The Intercultural Development Inventory (IDI) Assessment is a crucial tool within the CCLP program, helping participants not only identify where they are in terms of intercultural competence but also guiding them through the phases of development. Here's how it elevates the training experience: \nUnderstanding Key Developmental Phases: Throughout the program, participants will navigate various phases of intercultural development, progressing from a primarily monocultural perspective to a more inclusive intercultural viewpoint. This understanding is essential for fostering inclusive environments and navigating cultural differences effectively. Targeted Growth: By taking the IDI assessment at the beginning of the program, participants establish a clear baseline of where they currently stand in their intercultural development journey. We follow up with post IDI assessments as well conducted at the end of the program. This allows us to clearly measure the progress they've made, highlighting the growth in their ability to navigate and understand cultural differences more effectively over the 6-12 month program. We\u2019d love to set up a time to discuss how the how the IDI assessment and the CCLP program can be implemented to meet your team\u2019s needs. Please let me know what week works best, and I can send over some times to connect. \n\nLooking forward to your response.",

At XYZ, we are always striving to innovate and provide the most impactful solutions for fostering Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion within organizations. With that commitment in mind, we are excited to introduce our updated and elevated training program: The Cross Cultural Learning Partner (CCLP).\n\nWhat makes our CCLP program stand out from traditional DEI training programs? It\u2019s designed to offer a more personalized, in-depth, and continuous learning experience. Here\u2019s how:\nCollaborative Learning: Unlike typical trainings where participants learn individually, CCLP pairs each participant with a learning partner that is culturally different in a significant way. This partnership encourages mutual support and shared growth, making the learning process richer and more effective. The cultural differences between partners offer real, lived scenarios that can be explored through open communication. Extended Engagement: While most DEI sessions are limited to just a few hours, our CCLP program spans 6 to 12 months. This extended timeframe allows for a deeper exploration of cultural competencies, continuous learning, and the opportunity to apply and reflect on insights over time. Real-World Scenarios: CCLP moves beyond hypothetical situations by integrating your unique experiences into the training. This makes the learning more relevant and directly applicable to the challenges and opportunities within your organization. Measurable Growth: Understanding your progress is key to effective learning. CCLP includes pre- and post-assessments, enabling participants to track their development and gain clear insights into how much they\u2019ve grown after the program. We believe that our CCLP program offers a transformative approach to DEI training, and we would love to explore how it can benefit your team or organization. If you\u2019re interested in learning more or setting up a time to discuss further, please don\u2019t hesitate to reach out.\n\nLooking forward to connecting!",

        "body": "Hi <PERSON>,\r\n\r\nHope you\u2019re having a great week! I wanted to take this opportunity to provide you with our price points for some of our services.\r\n\r\nBelow you\u2019ll see an overview of our pricing for our Facilitated Sessions (Spotlights), Micro-Learnings, as well as our E-Learnings.\r\n\r\nDuring our call you mentioned the importance of a session that could start the journey and help set the tone. I\u2019ve included an overview & pricing for our facilitated session called Foundations of Diversity & Inclusion.\r\n\r\n\r\n  *   This session introduces the concepts of diversity, inclusion, and culture. Meant for audiences who are closer to the beginning of their organization\u2019s inclusion journey, this session differentiates between diversity and inclusion, touches on the powerful role that culture plays in driving behavior and expectations in the workplace, and offers examples of day-to-day actions which, although usually unintentional, contribute towards a sense of disengagement or lack of belonging. Examples of inclusive everyday behaviors are also provided, and an opportunity to brainstorm what you would do to practice inclusion through short scenarios. (1 Facilitator) (1 Hour Session) - $3,000 virtual facilitation.\r\n\r\nWhen it comes to our facilitated sessions, we also have what\u2019s called our Spotlight Series. These one-hour, interactive, deep-dive workshops that are focused on the experience of being a member of these communities, and contribute to building cultural competence, inclusion skills, and a culture of belonging throughout the organization. Here is some pricing info on our two latest Spotlights.\r\n\r\nFacilitated Sessions (Discount available for Spotlight Bundle, 11 Spotlights total)\r\n\r\n  1.  Spotlight on the Jewish Community (2 facilitators, 1 cultural insider & 1 ally) (1.5-hour session)- $4,500\r\n  2.  Spotlight on the Muslim Community (2 facilitators, 1 cultural insider & 1 ally) (1.5-hour session) - $4,500\r\n\r\nWe also understand you\u2019re interested in training around recruiting and how to be an effective leader. In my previous email I provided a link for our Micro Learning on Managing Bias in Performance Reviews. I think it ties in nicely with the topics you are interested in. We wanted to share prices with you on our digital learning solutions, that\u2019s both our Micro Learnings and E-Learnings. I understand you are interested in facilitated sessions, just want to make sure you know the different training and pricing options XYZ has.\r\n\r\nMicro Learnings (5-minute session to help enforce the right behaviors)\r\n\r\n  1.  Managing Bias In Performance Reviews - $1000 (includes access for 12 months for up to 30 employees)\r\n\r\nE- Learnings (20-minute session, self-paced, can enter and exit course at any time and pick up where they left off)\r\n\r\n  1.  Introduction to Managing Unconscious Bias - $1650 (includes access for 12 months for up to 30 employees) (discounts available for two & three year plans)\r\n\r\nWe would love to reconnect and walk you through any questions you might have. Let me know what dates work best for you and I\u2019ll send out some times to connect!",

Late September/October 1st session. <PERSON> gave an overview of XYZ's backgrounds and the types of trainings we provide. Autumn communications, use to work there and did a diversity workshop with us. Very focused on culture and learning opportunityHas seen us present before 25 remote employees, working across \u00a0the U.S Quarterly sessionsPlus up for managers if neededWhat workshop did they see us present? We went over all sort of different kinds of diversity. Not just race, example disability. <PERSON> asked about previous trainings? U.B, psychological safety, leadership: how to share feedback. Next steps: What type of content would you like to review? When you do provide these trainings, are they usually self paced learning opportunities? or is it more so an online workshop?What time frames work for your org? 1 hour? 4 hour? Spotlight Bundle? I think we should bring in a consultant for the follow up call. Could help build a learning journey for this prospect. Need to know budget! When would be the first impact? Do you have a topic in mind? Or are you looking for us to build a journey learning map? <PERSON> would like to gain the perspective of everyone at the company. Maybe a possible survey? Short attention spans. The <PERSON> time would be 1 hour and 30 minutes. Spotlights? Leadership training could be longer and more of a deep dive. Company wide training? Start with leaders first? Company wide is what <PERSON> would like. How many people leaders in the org? 10 are managers. 4 executive team. Start with 1 session and go from there. We need buy in from the <URL>nd her some Spotlight session overviews. Ideally have her pick the upcoming Hispanic Heritage Month. What does this training need to include? Incorporates feedback. DEI training, feedback, leadership training: recruiting, training, managing different styles of <URL>itial budget for this first session? Planning budget for next year. Around $2,000 dollar budget. Wants just 1 facilitator. We should talk to RP or a consultant for tips on what to recommend. Send agenda for latest XYZ Spotlights. Next meeting? Proposal first. ",

We found it to be an inspiring and impactful event and hope you did too! XYZ\u2019s, <PERSON> had the privilege of moderating the panel, \"The Future of DEI Amidst a Changing Landscape\" - we hope you found the discussion thought-provoking. Due to time constraints, there were many unanswered questions submitted in the Whova app, so we wanted to follow-up with you.\r\n\r\nXYZ has been committed to intercultural competence and inclusion in the workplace since 2000 \u2013 going through the ups and downs (but mostly ups!) with our clients, whether it\u2019s through strategic consulting, training, or creative, collaborative projects and brainstorming with L&D, DEI, and business leaders. May we set up a 30 minute chat to provide our responses to some of the questions asked and listen to the biggest problems you\u2019re trying to solve in your current environment? If it turns out there\u2019s an opportunity to partner on a project - big or small, now or later - then great. And if not, that\u2019s okay too \u2013 it would still be great to connect with you, provide some valuable resources and learn from you.\r\n\r\nPlease let us know which week you would like to meet, and we can send you our availability.\r\n\r\nThank you once again for taking the time to read this, and we look forward to meeting with you!",

We found it to be an inspiring and impactful event and hope you did too! XYZ\u2019s, <PERSON> had the privilege of moderating the panel, \"The Future of DEI Amidst a Changing Landscape\" - we hope you found the discussion thought-provoking. Due to time constraints, there were many unanswered questions submitted in the Whova app, so we wanted to follow-up with you.\r\n\r\nXYZ has been committed to intercultural competence and inclusion in the workplace since 2000 \u2013 going through the ups and downs (but mostly ups!) with our clients, whether it\u2019s through strategic consulting, training, or creative, collaborative projects and brainstorming with L&D, DEI, and business leaders. May we set up a 30 minute chat to provide our responses to some of the questions asked and listen to the biggest problems you\u2019re trying to solve in your current environment? If it turns out there\u2019s an opportunity to partner on a project - big or small, now or later - then great. And if not, that\u2019s okay too \u2013 it would still be great to connect with you, provide some valuable resources and learn from you.\r\n\r\nPlease let us know which week you would like to meet, and we can send you our availability.\r\n\r\nThank you once again for taking the time to read this, and we look forward to meeting with you!",

Identify why diversity and sense of belonging are decreasing at all levels\r\n  2.  Retention and development of diverse (race/ethnicity) talent\r\n  3.  Identify why BH is seeing lower scores in well-being for diverse (race/ethnicity only?) employees\r\n  4.  Driving accountability amongst leaders\r\n\r\nNext steps:\r\n\r\n  *   BH to discern how to send existing DEI data (EES insights, insights from discussions with HR, workforce data, etc.). We must understand the data behind these issues in order  in order to develop targeted solutions.\r\n  *   XYZ to perhaps review BH's current DEI training and provide opinion on what types of updates might be warranted.\r\n  *   <PERSON> and <PERSON> to discuss today's meeting takeaways with <PERSON> (VP, Talent, DEI, OD and Change Management).\r\n  *   Follow-up meeting scheduled for Monday, October 16th at 1 PM Central time.

Differences across age groups \u2013 we see evidence in EES and exit data \u2013 in that higher tenured employees (10 years+) report HIGH engagement and lower tenured don\u2019t. <PERSON>: That\u2019s probably because of all the changes in organization in the last few years (financial, covid, new CEO, culture has transitioned into more of a \u2018business\u2019 direction vs. \u2018people first\u2019).\u00b7 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Data from exit interviews\u00b7 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Internal listening sessions/focus groups- Not done formal internal listening sessions \u2013 focus groups, interviews, surveys.

In the next year will focus on additional populations. Capture disability data, S Orientation, gender identity. People self disclose a lot more freely in <PERSON> (done semi annually) than in Workday. For ex, in EES, 1200 ppl responded that are LGBTQ (out of 14k respondents \u2013 though BH has 18k employees total). In Workday, HUGELY less have reported. Similar with veterans and disability.

Its been a while.\r\n\r\nPer our call, I am attaching information on BRG/ERG toolkit that we developed for a client who needed some added assistance in 'professionalizing' their approach to BRG/ERGs. They found that they didn't have a standard model, or even a standard set of expectations for their BRGs, as each had developed organically over the years. They also found that their Executive Sponsorship was inconsistent among the BRGs.\r\n\r\nWe led multiple conversations with represented populations to see what they know of BRGs at the organization, what they expected from their BRGs, and what was keeping them from joining (if they hadn't). We also spoke to the business leadership to understand their expectations. We then used this data to form the training and consulting interventions for both the BRG leaders and the executive sponsors.\r\n\r\nI will schedule some time next week to discuss any questions you might have.\r\n\r\n<PERSON>\r\n\r\n<PERSON> (He/Him)\r\nChief Executive Officer\r\nXYZ\r\nOffice: <PHONE_NUMBER>\r\nMobile: <PHONE_NUMBER>\r\n\r\n\r\n[A picture containing font, graphics, logo, symbol  Description automatically generated]\r\nWebsite<",

I've had some time to go through the menu and have a few questions about pricing for each course.\r\n\r\nI'm interested in the following sessions, divided by type. Are they priced by the hour, by the session or both? It's a little of both and the number of faciltators. Let's assume we have 40 people in each session, would we need 3 or 4 sessions of each? We usually suggest that sessions be limited to 25-30 people in order to maximize interaction and engagement. We find that active participation suffers as the number of participants increases. We are flexible, though.\r\n\r\n  *   Facilitated learning\r\n     *\r\nCultural Competence & Inclusion Skill-Building: Building a Culture of Inclusion (all audiences)  Pricing is $8,000 per session.\r\n     *\r\nInclusion Skill-Building: Brave Conversations on Race + Power of Allyship Culture (all audiences) Pricing is $8,000 per session for each.\r\n     *\r\nCultural Competence & Inclusion Skill-Building: Building a Culture of Inclusion Pricing is $12,000 per session + Leading with Conscious Inclusion (managers & leaders)  Pricing is $8,000 per session\r\n  *   ELearning - We have two models for elearning; 1) a price based on org size which starts at $20k for up to 10,000 users, and 2) for smaller organizations we host the modules for $50 for each user (for 12 months). The latter would work best for you folks.\r\n     *   Foundations of Diversity & Inclusion (all audiences)\r\n     *   Fostering Collaboration (all audiences)\r\n  *   Mini-workshops\r\n     *   Foundations of Diversity & Inclusion Price is $3,600 per session\r\n     *   Spotlight on Intersectionality Price is $3,600 per session\r\n\r\nI realize I am repeating myself with the foundations courses, but I think it's important to offer this in different ways so the message clicks for everyone, and also because I don't know that everyone will attend each kind of session.\r\n\r\nCan you tell me what the cost of those selections would be, based on a company of 160 people?

        "body": "Thank you very much, <PERSON>! I've had some time to go through the menu and have a few questions about pricing for each course.\r\n\r\nI'm interested in the following sessions, divided by type. Are they priced by the hour, by the session or both? It's a little of both and the number of faciltators. Let's assume we have 40 people in each session, would we need 3 or 4 sessions of each? We usually suggest that sessions be limited to 25-30 people in order to maximize interaction and engagement. We find that active participation suffers as the number of participants increases. We are flexible, though.\r\n\r\n  *   Facilitated learning\r\n     *\r\nCultural Competence & Inclusion Skill-Building: Building a Culture of Inclusion (all audiences)  Pricing is $8,000 per session.\r\n     *\r\nInclusion Skill-Building: Brave Conversations on Race + Power of Allyship Culture (all audiences) Pricing is $8,000 per session for each.\r\n     *\r\nCultural Competence & Inclusion Skill-Building: Building a Culture of Inclusion Pricing is $12,000 per session + Leading with Conscious Inclusion (managers & leaders)  Pricing is $8,000 per session\r\n  *   ELearning - We have two models for elearning; 1) a price based on org size which starts at $20k for up to 10,000 users, and 2) for smaller organizations we host the modules for $50 for each user (for 12 months). The latter would work best for you folks.\r\n     *   Foundations of Diversity & Inclusion (all audiences)\r\n     *   Fostering Collaboration (all audiences)\r\n  *   Mini-workshops\r\n     *   Foundations of Diversity & Inclusion Price is $3,600 per session\r\n     *   Spotlight on Intersectionality Price is $3,600 per session\r\n\r\nI realize I am repeating myself with the foundations courses, but I think it's important to offer this in different ways so the message clicks for everyone, and also because I don't know that everyone will attend each kind of session.\r\n\r\nCan you tell me what the cost of those selections would be, based on a company of 160 people? We have 50-60 people who are people managers and would be in the manager & leader sessions.\r\n\r\nThank you!\r\n\r\n\r\nOn <LOCATION>, Mar 10, 2025 at 2:05\u202fPM <PERSON> <<EMAIL_ADDRESS><mailto:<EMAIL_ADDRESS>>> wrote:\r\n\r\nHi, <PERSON> \u2013\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAttached are the information deck and  proposal with pricing we discussed.
