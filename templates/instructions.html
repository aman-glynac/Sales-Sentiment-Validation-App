            <h2>üìã Your Task</h2>
            <p>You will be evaluating AI-generated sentiment analysis of sales deals. Your job is to determine how accurate the AI's assessment is compared to what you observe in the actual deal activities.</p>
            
            <h2>üîç What to Look For</h2>
            <p>As you review each deal, pay attention to these key elements:</p>
            
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Communication Patterns:</strong> How does the salesperson interact with the client? Are they proactive, responsive, professional?</li>
                <li><strong>Deal Progression:</strong> Is the deal moving forward, stagnating, or regressing? Look for concrete signs of advancement.</li>
                <li><strong>Client Engagement:</strong> How engaged is the client? Are they responding positively, asking questions, showing interest?</li>
                <li><strong>Professional Standards:</strong> Remember that salespeople are trained professionals. Standard business communication should be considered neutral, not positive.</li>
                <li><strong>Risk Indicators:</strong> Look for warning signs like delayed responses, avoided questions, or client hesitation.</li>
                <li><strong>Opportunity Indicators:</strong> Identify positive signals like client enthusiasm, referrals, or expansion discussions.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h2>üìä Rating System</h2>
            <p>You will rate each aspect of the AI's analysis on a scale of 1-5:</p>
            
            <ul>
                <li><strong>5 - Excellent:</strong> The AI's analysis is spot-on and insightful</li>
                <li><strong>4 - Good:</strong> The AI's analysis is mostly accurate with minor issues</li>
                <li><strong>3 - Fair:</strong> The AI's analysis is somewhat accurate but has notable gaps</li>
                <li><strong>2 - Poor:</strong> The AI's analysis has significant errors or misses important points</li>
                <li><strong>1 - Very Poor:</strong> The AI's analysis is completely wrong or irrelevant</li>
            </ul>
            
            <div class="highlight">
                <strong>‚ö†Ô∏è Important:</strong> You will also rate your confidence level (1-5) for each assessment and can provide optional notes explaining your reasoning, especially when you disagree with the AI's analysis.
